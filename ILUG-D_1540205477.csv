Tavish,,Tavishh,"on my machine it stops midway, and the client's TCP connection doesn't close, so it keeps waiting and times out",1492694189
Guneet,,guneetnarula,Confusing. It could just be some firewall between your local network and linode. But also if this was clearly a networking issue with linode then this problem being limited to one or two files is highly unlikely,1492694351
Guneet,,guneetnarula,How about deploying this on a different server and then trying the same request from your computer,1492694483

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called 'Linux', and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called 'Linux' distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",1494435229

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Still can't see any facebook scripts,1495052112
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I did find some on qz.com,1495052120
Quanon,,Quanon,not every where but almost everywhere,1495052185
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah,1495052192
cocoa,,cocoa1231,My vm.swappiness is set to 100,1495052304
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But it's not swapping,1495052309
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"like, at all",1495052312
cocoa,,cocoa1231,swap used: 188K,1495052321
Quanon,,Quanon,cause your physical ram is not full yet,1495052330
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Oh shit.. I should have set it to 0,1495052356
cocoa,,cocoa1231,or closer to that..,1495052364
cocoa,,cocoa1231,right?,1495052366
Quanon,,Quanon,it is always preferrable to use ram over swap,1495052368
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That's how it works?,1495052371
Quanon,,Quanon,"The kernel will swap only to avoid an out of memory condition, when free memory will be below vm.min_free_kbytes limit. See the ""VM Sysctl documentation"". vm.swappiness = 1. Kernel version 3.5 and over, as well as Red Hat kernel version 2.6.32-303 and over: Minimum amount of swapping without disabling it entirely.",1495052395
Quanon,,Quanon,you should always keep it to minimum,1495052439
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I wanna see how it goes when it's swapping everything,1495052456
Quanon,,Quanon,cause your ram is orders of magnitude faster and swapping won't really help but slow the machine down,1495052472
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I know, but still wanna take a stab at it",1495052485
Quanon,,Quanon,your machine will become unresponsive,1495052487
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Won't be the first time...,1495052498
Quanon,,Quanon,vm.swappiness = 100   The kernel will swap aggressively.,1495052562
Quanon,,Quanon,you are already at the right setting for that then,1495052572
Quanon,,Quanon,however,1495052579
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I thought it was ""When vm.swappiness% memory is used, then start swapping""",1495052604
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"in which case, it would be, ""When 100% memory is used, then start swapping""",1495052626
Quanon,,Quanon,so swapping only happens when physical  memory is out of available cache space,1495052643
Quanon,,Quanon,only in that condition would this variable really take effect I think... would need to read up more about it to confirm,1495052674
Quanon,,Quanon,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swappiness,1495052697
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But I've used this on my old Ubuntu installations. I increased vm.swappiness up to 100 and it used to swap even if the memory wasn't completely full,1495052729
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"Use ""the great suspender"" extn to suspend tabs in chrome. @cocoa1231",1495052776
Quanon,,Quanon,maybe it(physical mem) was cleared cause of the swap,1495052788
Quanon,,Quanon,"as in mem filled, some cache moved ot swap... mem freed up?",1495052821
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Maybe. I didn't look into that at that time. Lemme fill up my RAM to see if it starts swapping,1495052849
Quanon,,Quanon,"I think what you want is different,  you want cache to be always force used from disk ?",1495052856
Quanon,,Quanon,disk/swap,1495052883
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yes,1495052895
Quanon,,Quanon,try fork bomb :p,1495052932

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Firstly, AFAIK, creating an Arch Linux package is much easier than creating a debian package, and downgrading packages under the ABS is also much simpler.

Secondly, at least from my experience, apt breaks a lot more than pacman. I mean, pacman has not broken on me since I installed this installation 4/5 months ago. In contrast, I tried using Debian in a VM (and Linux Mint on my hardware) and both times something breaks on me. And I try to usually do the same stuff on both systems.

For me, debian based distributions have never been stable. But that's just a personal opinion",1501706134

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, Basically, this script. I use the same format for when I chroot everytime. Works every time",1501843695

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,,1501843965
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Okay, so I mounted the target partition under a new directory, ran that command, mounted proc, sys, and dev, and then chrooted, and it still doesn't work",1501844243
.,,rajudev,do not do the mountings before creating the chroot.. atleast that is not the way how I do it.,1501844288
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Okay. Lemme try then,1501844301
.,,rajudev,do the mountings afterwards,1501844313
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Nope. Still not working,1501844542
.,,rajudev,This is what I do. 1. Make a new directory  for the chroot. 2. Debootstrap the os to the newly created directory 3. cd .. out of the directory when debootstrap is finished 4. sudo chroot <directory name> 5. chroot just works at this point,1501844544

.,,rajudev,"keep trying, do not loose patience and faith in Tux :)",1501844629

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Okay, apt update's working when I boot into Debian. Still curious on why it wasn't working in the chroot",1501845049
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Another thing I've noticed with apt on my system is that it takes a really long time to actually start downloading. It's stuck on waiting for like 30 seconds before it actually starts downloading,1501845132
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"zypper, yum/dnf, and pacman all work almost instantaniously",1501845157
.,,rajudev,"well, it might be because of the differences in how packages are kept and managed on debian repositories. as well the implementation of apt",1501845231
.,,rajudev,"Also although we might bother about those 30 seconds, a usual user does not bother about such issues.",1501845269

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"I noticed something unusual today on my disk. Can someone explain
why/how this
 happens ?  I was just trying to take a look at my system, using df.
This is what I saw :

Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs        1.9G     0  1.9G   0% /dev
tmpfs           1.9G  264K  1.9G   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs           1.9G   11M  1.9G   1% /run
tmpfs           1.9G     0  1.9G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/sda3        50G  9.0G   38G  20% /
/dev/sda1       156M  4.5M  152M   3% /boot/efi
/dev/sda4       453G   11G  442G   3% /home
/dev/sda5       411G   71M  390G   1% /extra

 sda5 uses on 71 M out of 411 G but it shows 1%.  which itself is
arithmetically wrong. At the same time, sda4 has used 11G out of 453 G,
it shows only 3 % used. This is inconsistent with the percentage used by
sda5 (11G cannot be 3 times 71M). What is happening in my case (and why
does this happen only to me ) ? Or, is df cheating me ?

- help speaker prepare talk in a way more suited to the audience , as the volunteers are collecting the stats of the audience. Adding content along the way.
- there was feedback to help new speakers to practice before the talk. Be it 2hrs or a day or week before the meetup.
- cost for tea & snacks are borne by the volunteers. Till we implement another feedback received regarding funds, having monthly meetup costs half.

.,,rajudev,"It should be opened in different windows, that is intended behaviour",1502969379
.,,rajudev,It's already made,1502969390
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,"but why is it intended behaviour to open links in new windows when the page is mostly all blank below,",1502969423
.,,rajudev,because someone might want to open multiple sections of the website. opening in the same tab will take the user away from the web page,1502969911
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,hmmmm,1502969926
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,"well a user can always ""Ctrl+click"" or ""open in a new tab"" opening new tabs for default website is bad design",1502970009
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,bad usability design,1502970014
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,especially since page is quite empty,1502970021
.,,rajudev,it is not,1502970041
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,"should check that, It is not the best user friendly to open every page in new tab,",1502970185
.,,rajudev,where are you quoting this from?,1502970654
.,,rajudev,Always consider that the the user is not so tech savvy to know keyboard shortcuts.,1502970708
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,I prefer new tabs,1502970797
johndoe,,trivial_inanity,I prefer tabs,1502970815

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,How is it different from fseek?,1503337704
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,lseek is a system call which works on file descriptor and I believe fseek is a glibc wrapper for this system call which works on a FILE pointer,1503337784

Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,I am out of those 2,1503337843
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"Yes, fseek also takes offset but from 0 to file size. What does the offset in lseek means?",1503337851
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,python.........,1503337873
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"you have 3 args, first open file descriptor of the file you want to use lseek on, second - no of bytes you want to seek (+ve for forward, -ve for backward) third - you want to seek from current position or from the beginning or from current position or from the end of the file",1503337957
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"in python you could 
file_desc.seek( int(address, 16))",1503337959
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"Yes, but how does this helps my question is what I'm asking. @rinne_parad0x",1503337993
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"when you seek from the last byte in lseek, you jump some bytes and the file is said to have holes which do not take space on disk",1503338003
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,you asked can one seek to a memory address,1503338021
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"so, yes, one can seek",1503338026
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,that is how it answers,1503338033

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"I have a memory address. I want to seek to that specific address, can I do that.",1503338076
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"(I already use fseek, so no need for lseek, which is low-level as described by you)",1503338114

Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"1. Use ftell then calc the diff between addresses and then seek that much using fseek
2. Use lseek (fd, SEEK_SET, 0). This will tell you current location, then use lseek to seek to that address",1503338190
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"there you have it, both ways - ftell and fseek AND lseek and lseek",1503338205

Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"when there are like 200 msgs, we can read but when they get multiplied by 2 or 3, going through like 400 or 600 msgs makes the mood off and all the msgs are ignored",1503420208

Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"that is not a solution, right?",1503420353
.,,rajudev,right. I am discussing this with you to arrive on a conclusion,1503420384
.,,rajudev,"If a person has joined via telegram, would your response have been the same?",1503420422
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,maybe not but the reason would be different,1503420466
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,you cannot control anyone but a bot,1503420474
Rajat,Saini,rajataaron,@rajudev this matrix is a person or bot just clear my confussion first,1503420474
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,its a bot,1503420482

Rajat,Saini,rajataaron,k,1503420611
.,,rajudev,matrix is also a messaging platform just like telegram,1503420617
Rajat,Saini,rajataaron,👍🏻,1503420618
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,I have one proposal though,1503420652
.,,rajudev,As an experiment and example. I can converse to this group using Telegram or by using riot,1503420654
Rajat,Saini,rajataaron,,1503420665
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,rajudev: Now I am chatting via Matrix,1503420696

Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,K,1503420739
Rajat,Saini,rajataaron,ohhh thats the way,1503420755
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,rajudev: although IRC is not implemented yet,1503420788
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"rajudev: If 10 new users would have joined in Telegram group, they would have generated the same number of messages.",1503420829
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,the problem is a different one,1503420840
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,rajudev: It is just that some people are choosing a different approach to join the group,1503420857
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"rajudev: go ahead, I am listening",1503420875
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,th thing is,1503420892
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,there are a huge number of platforms to gather but it is not really a good option to be a gp on every single one of them,1503420926
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,why?,1503420929
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"Because that would make what we are seeing now, we will have to connect each and every single thing",1503420951
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"if we are ultimately linking, why not just be on  at most 2 or 3 platforms",1503420974
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"like Telegram ( which techie does not use it), Slack (am not there and I personally don't like it), IRC (Telegram is the new IRC)",1503421004
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"in all and all, managing one thing is much easier and if they have to join that gp on their fav app/platform, why not on Telegram only (note: I am NOT saying we restrict to Telegram itself only, I am just saying)",1503421069
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"rajudev: Exactly. Why should one join different platforms for a similar group, be it Telegram/Matrix/Slack/IRC ?",1503421113
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,and I even don't know Matrix exists,1503421139
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,rajudev: but what if I can join the same group irrespective of the service I choose to join it..,1503421170
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,rajudev: now you know that Matrix exists and it is being extensively used as well,1503421192

Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,well can't argue with that,1503421446

.,,rajudev,But they can still connect to the same group,1503421725
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,How exactly is Telegram not technical enough,1503421736
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,the technicality is in gp and not on platform,1503421748

Current we have just less than 200 people in here. What if this increases to 2000 ? You cant complain that people dont talk in here. Usually in technical group chats, if you need somepone's attention, you mention their username so that they get alerted.

Nishant,Guleria,NishantGuleria,So do i need to make it bootable again,1503499064
Nishant,Guleria,NishantGuleria,Is that what you're suggesting,1503499070
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,rebuild the iso,1503499075
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You should use Rufus for making linux USB drives,1503499075

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,You don't have package managers in slackware?,1503555603
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,They actually do,1503555808
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,again depends when we mean package they have tar archived files managed by utilities,1503555848
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,so i would argue they do,1503555858
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,,1503555910
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,In iOS the same stuff is know as an APP the lame user does not know and is managed by iTunes,1503555956
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,so will we say they do not have some sort of package management,1503555975
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,i would NO,1503555978
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,for me anything with Zipped or Tar archive directory would qualify as package any day,1503556022
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"So compile from source everything in slackware, right?",1503556062
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,that you can do on any Linux distro technically speaking,1503556091

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"Acha, nice",1503556117
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,naa internally they all are doing the same shit,1503556132
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,Yeah,1503556139
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,its just to make the user feel more comfortable there are so many wrappers,1503556160
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,yes they make end users life a lot easy for sure,1503556173
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,since the end user will get precompiled binaries,1503556191
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,that way and he need not struggle with dependencies,1503556211
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,I have heard somewhere that plan9(or inferno) is good for learning more about Unix(same devs). Aisa Hain Kya?,1503556275
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Yes anything you start poking around you learn something,1503556305
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,depends on where you want to go or what you want to learn,1503556334
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"""Information Is Free ... U HAVE 2 KNOW"" this line fits here",1503556359
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,its all related to time so how much of it you have and how much you want to deep dive into it ... there is actually no end to this cycle if you ask me :P,1503556424
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"that is when you should ask yourself this question ""Why ? """,1503556452
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,that will reduce the amount of time you spend on unecessary info,1503556483
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,you cannot ignore or avoid it but just reduce it,1503556500

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,hmm that reminds me i need to show them how to debug today using wireshark,1503558501

- reaching out to  LUG heads, profs, ""oss companies"" and other ""technologists"" is a nice way. 
- Providing certificates(digital) to students giving presentations
- Themed meetups( at last meet, most came for hardware stuff)
- Planning agenda at the meet itself by asking people (which would create engagement and help in ""theme-ing"")",1503589488

Sahil,,warlord77,We haven't bridged irc yet,1503623858

> Matrix Bridge is such a Pro Free Software idea and why is it encouraged and pushed through our throat here on this channel ?
> 
I am not a pro free software evangelist. I'm a privacy advocate. I dont prefer to use the term free software. I only used the term open source. For hardcore free software fans, there is Free Software Community of India channel in both matrix, and irc with around 200 people. Look up the difference. Free softrware, Open source software & hardware, Linux, they all go hand in hand.
If it was me explaining about matrix that irritated all of you in here, well, then all I can tell is that I am totally disappointed in all of you. If you cannot keep an open mind or if you have too much resistance to change, you will NEVER thrive in technological career. I believe most of you are students here. My suggestion, is to try out various technologies, analyze and then decided whether its good for you or not. Biased dismissal of technology is not the best action a learned enginner would do. Id like to ask, those who are revolting against matrix here, have you took time to understand what it is? Have you visited its website?

That is a choice i have. What power do you have to refrain me from doing so ? For example, When I say ""RISC-V is a good alternative to ARM"" and try to explain its advantages over other architectures, you have a few options - 1) be curious and understand what I'm telling makes sense, or 2) if you're convinced that you do not agree with it, you can argue back solely on the technical merit of it. 3) Ignore the discussion and carry on with your work
But the statement you just made, makes it personal. ""Else I will leave folks to there wisdom"" Do you realize that you're sort of threatening? And do I care you leave or not? Absolutely not. Argue on the technical merits or demerits of a technology. Not on personal actions. They are pointless, and waste of time. Rather, if you are arguing on technical topics, people watching the discussion might learn a thing or two.",1503637981
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"Dude everyone here knows me better that a  privacy freaking someone from somewhere , the things i have been talking about has got nothing to do with technology or learning again may lord Ganesha give you some wisdom  and patience to read and understand others and live peacefully ever after",1503638308

Then probbaly you dont belong here. I'd like the admins to clarify what is the primary motive of this group. Satyakam Goswami (Telegram) and friends came here first, so they should be knowing what this group was made for. So if I am overstepping, communicate it clearly",1503639101
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,again this is paraphrasing and redirecting the coversation to third party who have no interest in this banter,1503639286
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: If two people are having an argument, and they do not converge, its a standard practice to bring in the third party to analyze and take  a decision.

Otherwise, they reserve the right to ban anyone who does not adhere to the group rules",1503639426
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Oh that makes me see myself as one of the admins which i never realized  😊,1503639516

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"rajudev: I appreciate the fact that people here are vocal and do not refrain from voicing there opinions down.

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,anyway my point is in the name of technology integration or growth or people we are loosing focus of the group,1503641865

https://www.loomio.org/d/LTpSdMuX/debian-packaging-pre-requisites
Debian Packaging pre requisites - Loomio
On previous packaging workshops, we had to spent a lot of time troubleshooting issues when people used older versions of Ubuntu which had older version of dh-make, gem2deb, npm2deb etc. So we thought of clearly mentioning the pre requisites so we can use the available time more efficiently. You MUST have a debian unstable system (physical, virtual machine or a container) lxc If you already have a GNU/Linux system, lxc would be the easiest to setup. Install lxc using this command sudo apt-get…",1503991745

Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,here is archwiki link for it https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-nspawn this is similar to using lxc but since systemd is now default in all linux distrib there isnt much extra to add to system to get it running,1503994062

Akash,Mishra,akash47,There is no mention of any dedicated activity which seeks to educate the audience about software freedom and the right to privacy.,1504975210
Akash,Mishra,akash47,Talks by other communities talking about what software freedom means for their group is good but it still doesnt tell the audience what software freedom should mean to them. It doesnt tell them why they should care about it in the first place.,1504975291
Akash,Mishra,akash47,"Since its a collaborative event, ILUGD would like to actively help out in organizing it.
In addition to the groups talking about what software freedom means to them, We would like to hold atleast 2 talks on educating the audience about software freedom and privacy.",1504975351

Simply giving a talk about foss and it's benefit would not do anything. One needs to understand the people and connect at a more grassroot level.

Raghav,,Rwbhu,I will recommend that folks look at an embedded Linux flavor like openwrt or even raspbian,1506358570
Raghav,,Rwbhu,To learn Linux,1506358578
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Over Arch,1506358582
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Since embedded Linux has just the fundamental nuts and bolts and nothing else,1506358621
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Easier to learn how Linux works at the core,1506358638
Raghav,,Rwbhu,And work on only the essential packages which will be found in all Linux versions,1506358665
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Raghav I have two points here. Firstly, a lot of embedded Linux systems don't bother with higher level functions like graphical interfaces or package management and stuff (some do), so they aren't a complete guide to learn linux. And secondly,  distributions like Arch, Gentoo, and slack are a stepping stone to stuff like LFS because they don't just throw you at the deep end of the pool",1506397610
RandomAcess,,Random_access,@cocoa1231 and @Raghav can we pin some basic books/links/pdfs which could probably lead somebody who is new to Linux to a right path. The same could also be a yardstick to where a person's knowledge would be----something like beginners/intermediate/expert,1506407937
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Hmm. Okay, I'll see if I can compile a list",1506407985
Raghav,,Rwbhu,"So, if the internet is a web, Linux running on routers and servers is basically a stream of pipes. To learn how these pipes work (primary functionality of the OS) focus on the fundamentals of the system",1506408312

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,Please collaborate with @akash47 @warlord77,1506410555
Raghav,,Rwbhu,"Books may not be as useful as solving real world problems. I have a few of them, that need solving. The doing of these problems will address this requirement of learning real world Linux. You can please direct message me if one is interested in working on Linux / C++ / networking /embedded systems/ Raspberry Pi. Cheers",1506412396
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,so what do you need again?,1506412479
RandomAcess,,Random_access,While I agree to this thought...think this as a step by step learning process for anybody interested in Linux. A link/website/book suggested will simply take somebody from the foundation to the flavours of utilities Linux has.,1506428876

Hello all, reminder & updates about the implementation of issue tracker mechanism for open designs

We have a group 'Open Design' in code.swecha.org(self-hosted GitLab[https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq])

For better organization, I'm proposing to segregate design requests into 3 projects.

Project 1: Branding
Style Guides and Logos will be part of this project.

Project 2: 2D graphics
Posters/banners for events/announcement/info-graphics etc. will be part of this project.
[this project will take style info inputs from Project 1: Branding]

Project 3: 3D
3D designs for 3D printing, Vitural Reality and Augmented Reality etc will be part of this project.

Please suggest your improvisations/critique on these to re-organize or propose new projects.",1506802438

Paras,Verma,,"Dual booted Ubuntu 17.10 with Windows 10 (1709), needed to remove ubuntu, deleted the ubuntu partition, removed ubuntu from EFI partition.

Now bios is not saving any changes.
No external flash drive or bootable media is being detected.

And Ubuntu grub still prevents windows from loading.

How to resolve this issue?",1508501153
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Would like that the whole 144GB ext4 partition joins / and increases the size of my / partition.,1508502607
Raghav,,Rwbhu,But max size of the / partition is 19.9 gb and the 144 gb is not an option as an expansion of the/ when I resize the partition,1508502608
Raghav,,Rwbhu,How to do this...,1508502619
Paras,Verma,,"Because the partition ised for root (linux installation) lies after the 144gig unallocated space on the physical drive.

This is not posible without a third party utility.

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/399626/why-is-kali-linux-so-hard-to-set-up-why-wont-people-help-me

If you really want to use Kali, use it in a VM. It is not meant to be your host OS as it is terribly insecure. 

If you don't want to use Kali, and are looking for something bleeding edge, you may as well try Antergos. Or any other mainstream distribution that's not Kali.

Udit,Gupta,uditwapt,"With the increasing advent of AI, and the 'bot culture' in vogue, CYBER CUP'17 presents to you 

"" ANDROBOTS ""
An amazing platform where you get to design your own bots & contribute towards automating as many mundane tasks as possible. 

- The participants have to design their own bots at the venue and present their bots. 

For the backend of the bot you could use an API(such as api.ai) or code it using Python,node js etc & for front end you can either use a messaging platform (like Telegram, SLACK)or you can build an android app etc.  

It could be anything from a sensor bot, customer support chat bots, a fun Emojify bot, horoscope bot & what not! 

Think out ot the box, Showcase your coding skills & come out with an 'extraordinary product'.

Innovation is the key ! 

So stop thinking...& start building !

Join us on 24th Oct 2017 and let's tread on together in this techie ride of bots!

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,<b>Yash Bhardwaj:</b> Srihari Unnikrishnan (Telegram): are you asking about my problem ?,1508940873
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,yeah,1508940887
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,if its hardware problem or driver problem syslog will have details,1508941170
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"<b>Yash Bhardwaj:</b> Srihari Unnikrishnan (Telegram):

TL;DR;
the thing is that used used ubuntu 17.04 as my primary os , and i could connect to an access point namely AP913, if  by chance or some reason , if this connection got disrupted . then it would not connect untill i would manually forget the connection [ i.e. delete the saved credential entry [using gui] ]  , only then it used to connect again.
some time later even this trick/jugad stoped working .
but i must tell it worked better in windows and kali.
this led me to believe that it has something to do with drivers .
although i did not look for the appropriate drivers then.
not the problem is that i am finally in a windows session and the device is connected[ i just noticed , lol]
but after some time i will definitely get disconnected and once it gets disconnected fom AP913 , it will not be able to connect to AP913 , and at the same time will easily connect to AP912 [which offers a lower speed]",1508941364

please correct me if i am wrong",1508941629

.,,rajudev,I have got this problem many times on my system. But fsck has always worked for me. Because fsck was newer enough to check the partition for errors,1509257354
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Tell. Me the command to update it,1509257392
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,I will,1509257393
.,,rajudev,so changing those numbers should not do anything.,1509257404

vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,"If you open ""top"" or ""Htop"" when yes command is running. You can monitor cpu usage. So if  one yes is running, a core gets utilised. I got an octa core processor. Theoretically 9th yes command can't run.",1509712838
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,I thought it was due to stdout but redirecting it to a file doesn't take up core,1509712839

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Ubuntu mate and linux mint are excellent choices firstly. Secondly, UM and LM will both stay out of your way, and let you get to work. Manjaro is pretty amazing too (and a personal favourite) but its more geared towards new users who wanna dig into Linux.

That bring said, once you understand Linux well enough, the distro doesn't matter that much. Want stability? Go for Debian. Want bleeding edge software? Arch/antergos/manjaro. Want security? Fedora or cent os  or open SUSE. You're paranoid and have shit loads of time? Gentoo, Slackware and lfs",1510046168

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Yash Bhardwaj: What happens when I uninstall termux . Does it clean everything it brought with itself, packages etc  .",1510591426

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: ?,1510591499
Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,Yes cause you modified the sub system and removing that removes it's modification too,1510591554
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,Does uninstall off app result in removal of the sub system,1510591651
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,Is the sub system a subset of the apps user space,1510591763
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,?,1510591765
Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,Uninstall will remove apps data so yes,1510593997
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,Apps data vs the file system tree.,1510594321
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,App data could be some config files for the sub tree it creates,1510594342
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,And that sub tree may not be removed,1510594354

yash,,imyashbhardwaj,Give me an answer,1510596216
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"As far as I understand (which, let's be honest, isn't much about Android), the configsa and other files generated by the app are removed during uninstall. but, if you have used the app to create files (such as DroidEdit to create text files), those won't delete.

In case of Termux, yes, Uninstalling the app would remove all the packages installed by it. It installs them in a sandbox, and that sandbox is part of app data, which is delete when an app is removed.

I might be wrong though. Anyone wanna correct me?",1510600743
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: If it is sandboxed then why does it have to deny me permission to ls on / dir,1510629825
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: Also do they hardlink the sdcard in their subsystem ? Which (subsystem) itself is supposed to sit in the sdcard,1510630008

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,What maps are you talking about in DDG ?,1510655505
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,No bing hipsters in here?,1510655725
Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,I meant like goggle has his maps and it's quite handy with the search engine. But you have to DDG some other map service even to find the nearest post office. But technically it's not about DDG when I think of it now. My bad.,1510655884
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"if you wanna be a troll i am a game , what about it ?",1510656882
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,can you give an example so that i can try,1510656940
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,I'm just curious dude. I find it funny that people are more willing to use DDG than bing for most things - to the extent that bing actually tried to incentivize people to use it by offering some sort of point reward system.,1510657537

.,,rajudev,"Regarding the points in the image. 
I only use the Arduino IDE when I need to to transfer the code to Arduino. 
To write my code I use either nano/micro/atom text editors.

.,,rajudev,"Many times, along with writing code I have to open and read the whole source code of the libraries in order to use it efficiently along with my code.",1511005575
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,"To be fair though, most arduino libraries are like 1 object and a small amount of functions. Things like this are almost inevitable given the plug and play nature Arduino was intended to have. I actually think if people want a gentle introduction to micros these days Mbed is significantly nicer from a dev point of view.",1511005992
.,,rajudev,I think overhead of reading libraries is fine for the modularity that the plug and play feature provided by the arduino ecosystem.,1511006643

I have used arduino in slightly bigger Robots measuring over a meter and weighing over 25 KGs. 

Also there was considerable complexity in terms of designing and interfacing of both mechanical and electronics aspects of it. 

I understand your point of view, but I believe that arduino is equally capable of being used in  robotics even on industrial scale.",1511008799

Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,"I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!",1511635166

1) It is not possible as of now. By that I mean, theoretically it is possible but there is no app/feature built in for enabling or disabling this.
There is a feature though to disable/enable access to contacts on your phone for Android apps. But it works on global scope and not available right now for individual apps. 

2) SFOS has redefined how a user should interact with a phone. So if you come from Android/iOS land, you would find it hard to get started straight on. But there's a 5 min tutorial app built in. If anyone takes that 5 minutes tutorial, even an average Joe can use SFOS.",1511710060

On 12th Dec - Tuesday, Dream11 - the cricket fantasy league company is organizing a special online hiring event on CutShort, an AI recruitment platform.


They will have a live webcast with the actual tech team that built a platform for massive scale (1M requests/min). You can connect and interact with them. If you're open to new jobs, this event offers the fastest and easiest way to get hired. Register here: https://goo.gl/JiRws2


The Dream11 Code Challenge

Dream11 is looking for bright folks across tech, design, data science, product management and so on.


But for developers, Dream11 has floated a tech challenge. Unlike a typical hackathon, this challenge is much more practical and shorter. It's a 90 min test that if solved will get you a fast tracked hiring process and a certificate of accomplishment from CutShort.


Why work at Dream11?

Dream11 is India’s leading fantasy sports platform with a growing user base of over 15 million+ Indians playing fantasy cricket, football, kabaddi & basketball. Dream11 is a series C funded startup with marquee investors like Multiple Equity, Kalaari Capital and the US based hedge fund -Think Investments.

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: and easier to get along will be highly prefered,1512979670

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: what else,1512979804
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"For my side it would be Qt, the only thing I have worked with in python..",1512979805
Kuntal,M,hellozee,for GUIs,1512979814
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: okay,1512979869
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"you could design GUIs in Qt Designer and use them in python, there is an utility for converting Qt Designers XML into python files",1512979892

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Use either kivy, or if you want a native feel to your app, use pygobject",1512982997
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Kivy is easier tho. And causes you less headaches,1512983030
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But you can always use Glade,1512983037
cocoa,,cocoa1231,For pygobject,1512983046
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: what is a native app ?,1512983077
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: is it like a normal firefox type window,1512983093
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: that's what i always thought it is,1512983108
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"@cocoa1231 unless you are going for android, Qt provides more native look for desktop",1512983252
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Only on QT based desktops,1512983864
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Like plasma or lxqt,1512983870
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Others use GTK,1512983874
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Even window managers like i3 and openbox have better support for GTK than Qt,1512983891
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: how about tkinter ?,1512983926
cocoa,,cocoa1231,It won't look native anywhere,1512983963
cocoa,,cocoa1231,idle is written in Tkinter,1512983980
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And I don't recommend kivy for desktop apps for Linux,1512984013
Kuntal,M,hellozee,😂😂,1512984017
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Qt provides native look and feel for even windows and mac,1512984057
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I noticed that when using plasma the compositor is disabled when kivy is running. Weird,1512984060
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, but he wants to build a Linux app",1512984075
Kuntal,M,hellozee,you didn't get the point..,1512984096
cocoa,,cocoa1231,?,1512984103
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Plus Qt can be heavy,1512984143
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: i got the point,1512984146
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: that is a problem,1512984162
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"so will be every mature, good looking GUI kit...",1512984239
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"when comes about performance better use something like wxWidgets, FLTK, tkinter, they are pretty light..",1512984277
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, but why use a heavy toolkit when you can get the job done with a more stripped down toolkit?
And plus GTK is a pretty rich toolkit, without sacrificing memory",1512984300
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That goes to another extreme of extremely light but a pain in the ass toolkits,1512984330
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I find GTK to be a nice balance between the two ends of the spectrum,1512984348
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But you should try out some toolkits to see which one suits you yash,1512984368
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Because at the end of the day, if the app works, no one gives a shit on how it looks :P",1512984393
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Kivy apps have a unique advantage though,1512984461
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Kivy allows you to create custom widgets easily,1512984471
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Why won't my message edit...,1512984491
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Anyway, try out tkinter, pyqt, and pygobject (and kivy too maybe?) To see which one fits you",1512984522
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"So does Qt, you just inherit a widget and override it's paintEvent function..",1512984561
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Hmm. I haven't used Qt that much, so I'll take your word for it",1512984596
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"For me, the selling point of kivy is the .kv  language. I hate using graphical designers to build GUIs, and kivy provides a pretty easy way to script the GUI.",1512984655

The FCC vote to destroy the Net Neutrality protections on Dec. 14 cannot stand. 

I’m calling on you to work with your colleagues to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a ""resolution of disapproval"" reversing the FCC's vote. 

The FCC's Dec. 14 decision willfully ignored the outcry from tens of millions of people, and it abdicated the FCC's responsibility to protect the internet from ISP blocking and discrimination. The FCC has injured our economy and free speech in just one action, all without so much as a single public hearing. 

We need members of Congress to stand up for the open internet and for the digital civil rights of their constituents now. Please use the CRA to pass a Resolution of Disapproval to overturn the FCC's December 14 ""Restoring Internet Freedom"" vote.

Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,I have more messages then anyone has ever sent in matrix,1514297488
Raghav,,Rwbhu,What are the best practices for embedded devices uploading data securely to a central server ? Encryption or is VPN and ssh enough ?,1514298420
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: Raghav:  Wouldnt VPN add more overhead to the embedded device ? if its something capable, then its fine. But what level of security do you want ? If you could tell the use case, I can suggest better",1514304444
Raghav,,Rwbhu,VPN is  huge.,1514304881
Raghav,,Rwbhu,I have around 20mb of text files to upload daily to the servers,1514304917
Raghav,,Rwbhu,From the embedded Linux,1514304930
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Openwrt devices.,1514304938
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: Raghav: for openwrt devices vpn is not a big deal. I was think devices like bluetooth beacons, cortex m4 kind devices. If the server to which you want to transfer the data has a static ip, then you can try registering for a domain, get a free lets encrypt certificate, and simply use https to communicate with the server. Usual https is quite secure, unless you are paranoid and you dont trust the web chain of trust. Then you will have to encrypt your files with PKI (gpg) and send it along",1514305286
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: BUt the basics of server safety applies here. Make sure you dont have unnecessary ports open on the server, etc",1514305615
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: In case you dont want to get a domain, its not impossble to get an SSL certificate bound to your static IP, rather than a common name, but i've never tried.",1514305615
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: I dont know if letsencrypt system accept IP bound certs,1514305681
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: Something you can try ;),1514305690
Raghav,,Rwbhu,For some reason I don't have https,1514305736
Raghav,,Rwbhu,And VPN packages are quite heavy on the routers,1514305766
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: how come? you dont need a VPN server running on the client,1514305825
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: on your router, you only need a vpn client",1514305836
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: how is it heavy ?,1514305841
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: and if you dont want an http based system, then your other option would be some kind of decentralized tech. That would be more complex than https. for example, IPFS",1514306011
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: well I dont have any quantitative results to prove IPFS is complex than simple http,1514306073
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: but it needs an additional daemon doing its thing in your router,1514306103
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: but you already have the necessary http backend to do the job in openwrt based stuff,1514306118
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: and the IPFS daemon is IMO relative more heavy than a VPN plugin,1514306153
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: OR, if you feel adventurous try ZeroMQ",1514306376
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: pretty lightweight, extremely fast",1514306382
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: but you have to look deeper how to deal with security, that was your primary concern. If light weight is the factor, zeromq is a no brainer",1514306430
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: encryption in Zeromq would AFAIK require you to manually generate the certificates,1514306499
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: those things are automated if you use simple http, with letsencrypt",1514306521
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Because of my other stuff running on the same.devices.,1514307033
Raghav,,Rwbhu,And the embedded devices are tiny 4MB flash capacity only,1514307058
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: 4MB is indeed quite small for an openwrt dev. They are quite old, arent they ?",1514307195
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: then zmq is your best bet,1514307209
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: which soc is it ?,1514307253
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Ar71xx mips,1514307565
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Which VPN is the best amongst these ...,1514307603
Raghav,,Rwbhu,"openVPN, strongswan tinc VPN",1514308139
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Didn't find zero mq in the repos,1514308433
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Found mosquito client nossl as well as ssl,1514308450
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Mosquito broker also,1514308458
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: thats probably because of zmq licensing terms,1514308522
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: i think you dont need a broker for zmq. it may be an advantage over mosqito,1514308547
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: i remember reading somewhere,1514308552
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: i heard that fedora switch from some other mqtt protocol to zeq for their fedmsg system, and got 100 times improvement",1514308592

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"They're a kernel feature that's been around for quite a while. You can install the libcgroup package to play around with cgroups. It's not that libcgroups installs cgroups, it provides some tools to manage cgroups, one of which is cgexec",1514824239

Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,have to do some grub hacking for that,1515065335
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,or maybe not,1515065340
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,just dump your ubuntu boot image on a usb,1515065352
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,make a small raw insall vm file and dump it on the usb too,1515065365
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,make a script inside the usb ubuntu to run at bootup,1515065376

If Operating Systems Ran The Airlines... 

UNIX Airways 

Everyone brings one piece of the plane along when they come to the airport. They all go out on the runway and put the plane together piece by piece, arguing non-stop about what kind of plane they are supposed to be building.

Air DOS 

Everybody pushes the airplane until it glides, then they jump on and let the plane coast until it hits the ground again. Then they push again, jump on again, and so on... 

Mac Airlines 

All the stewards, captains, baggage handlers, and ticket agents look and act exactly the same. Every time you ask questions about details, you are gently but firmly told that you don't need to know, don't want to know, and everything will be done for you without your ever having to know, so just shut up.

Windows Air 

The terminal is pretty and colourful, with friendly stewards, easy baggage check and boarding, and a smooth take-off. After about 10 minutes in the air, the plane explodes with no warning whatsoever. 

Windows NT Air 

Just like Windows Air, but costs more, uses much bigger planes, and takes out all the other aircraft within a 40-mile radius when it explodes.

Windows XP Air 

You turn up at the airport,which is under contract to only allow XP Air planes. All the aircraft are identical, brightly coloured and three times as big as they need to be. The signs are huge and all point the same way. Whichever way you go, someone pops up dressed in a cloak and pointed hat insisting you follow him. Your luggage and clothes are taken off you and replaced with an XP Air suit and suitcase identical to everyone around you as this is included in the exorbitant ticket cost. The aircraft will not take off until you have signed a contract. The inflight entertainment promised turns out to be the same Mickey Mouse cartoon repeated over and over again. You have to phone your travel agent before you can have a meal or drink. You are searched regularly throughout the flight. If you go to the toilet twice or more you get charged for a new ticket. No matter what destination you booked you will always end up crash landing at Whistler in Canada.

Linux Air 

Disgruntled employees of all the other OS airlines decide to start their own airline. They build the planes, ticket counters, and pave the runways themselves. They charge a small fee to cover the cost of printing the ticket, but you can also download and print the ticket yourself.

When you board the plane, you are given a seat, four bolts, a wrench and a copy of the seat-HOWTO.html. Once settled, the fully adjustable seat is very comfortable, the plane leaves and arrives on time without a single problem, the in-flight meal is wonderful. You try to tell customers of the other airlines about the great trip, but all they can say is, ""You had to do what with the seat?""

Example:
Sorry, this is the best analogy on the subject of linux, has been around for a long time, and is anonymous.

BTW, linux is the kernel, GNU/GPL software make up the rest of the OS and apps.  GNU/Linux is the way lawyers will say it in court.",1515396792

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,or was it 27%?,1516043006
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I think you're confusing anti matter with dark matter/energy. Anti matter is time-reversed matter. It's a complete mirror image of any given particle. Whereas dark matter is the stuff that doesn't react electromagnetically and dark energy is the force that's expanding the universe,1516043063
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"No, its 5%.",1516043075
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That can't be. If that were then that 5% would annihilate with another 5% of anti matter,1516043115

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called 'Linux', and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called 'Linux' distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",1516471527

Kuntal,M,hellozee,yup,1516911045

Guys!

We are HashInclude, Delhi University's Cluster Innovation Centre. Exploiting people's addictiveness to WhatsApp, we decided to drop a message.

*Cluster Innovation Centre's Month of Code*, or CMoC for short is an event focused on introducing students to open source development. You get to work with some of the most experienced mentors from various places, including Indian Institute of Technology, London School of Economics and more.

How does this benefit you?
You get to 'apply' your programming skills in real life projects and be prepared for *Google Summer of Code*!

There're goodies if you do good!

Here's the link to the Github repo with all the required information,
https://github.com/clusterinnovationcentre/CMoC

You can find the student manual here,

ICFOSS intends to conduct a Women Hackathon, 3 – day residential camp for college students during 2-4 February, 2018 at ICFOSS Training Centre, Technopark.

Learning and knowledge creation process in students are heavily mediated by their gender. Based on this fact some of the sessions are intended to initiate open discussion and brainstorming on how the issue of gender and technology play out in our society. And we are trying to see technology through the lens of gender.

There will be classes on Free Software, Programming, Expert talks, Film Screening on Free Software, Interactive fun games etc. in this programme. We hope that there will be more bonding between the students to transfer the ideas of Free Software at the end of this programme.

Food and accommodation expenses of these selected students will be met by ICFOSS during these 3 days. They will be provided with an e-certificate of participation.",1517220202

A good way to help Krita Devs - Triaging bugs on the bug tracker. As Krita gets more popular there will be more users and in turn there will be more bug reports. This is a sign of healthy project but as well know Krita is run by volunteers and bug triaging takes a lot of time of the devs.
Bug triaging is checking whether the bug is reproducible or not, asking for information and doing the initial weeding of duplicated bug reports. We users can really help the devs in this department and this will help them save time to actually work on making Krita more awesome.
Refer to this document for instructions -  and get started
Here is a list of bugs in Krita for triaging.

Data format: nested list train_label has values 1 & 2 at positions 1, 2, 3 and 4.

I am trying to combine these two lists.

Rijul,Gulati,kryptxy,"Hello, can I share a python project (open-source) in this group?",1518578041
Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,Yupz,1518578155
Rijul,Gulati,kryptxy,"Hi all,
I'd like to share a python program I wrote while learning python.

It's a command-line torrent search program that fetches and downloads torrents from various torrent-hosting sites. I named it Torrench (TORRENt searCH). It's cross-platform and is completely open-source.

What it does 
It fetches a list of torrent proxies and checks if the torrent proxy is available. If it is, it fetches results and displays results in terminal/cmd window.

Sites supported 
TPB, KAT, RarBg, Limetorrents, libgen, 1337x, Distrowatch, and many more (please see documentation).

Features
- Load torrent to client from torrench (configurable)

- Cross-site search: Search more than one site with a single command.

And much more...

I have included samples along with required configuration instructions in documentation.

Hope you find it useful. Suggestions/Feedbacks are more than welcome :)

list1 = [t, shift+t, s, f]
list2 = [tiled,pseudo_tiled,floating,fullscreen]

What that entry is doing is seeing what is the index of the keypress from list1 (so for instance, mod3+s would mean that the 2nd index was pressed, mod3+f would be the 3rd), and executing the the command corresponding to the same index (so if mod3+s was pressed, the command executed would be bspc node -t floating, mod3+f would be bspc node -t fullscreen).",1519558337

I was considering it to be {(t,shift) + (t,s,f)}

Aditya,Agrawal,adityaagrawal,"I'm facing a problem, I moved from 2 Linux distros to 4, adding elementary and Kali to the hard disk, now I want to share ubuntu's home directory (home directory is on a separate partition) among all of them, I tried making separate folder for each distro, moving everything in that home directory to respective folders, mounting same partition as home and using usermod to change home directory location but Everytime it gives me that home directory isn't found, how can it be, is there a better way?",1520234444
Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,Not a good idea,1520234600
Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,Use docker containers if you want to use specific utility of that distro,1520234629

Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,if correctly mounted a seperate home can be mounted on all OSes,1520235151
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,as long as the DM version is same for all OSes,1520235171
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,for example kde or gnome version should match exactly,1520235188

Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,the third level is not important,1520235270
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,"so preferably use some kind of ""rolling"" distros",1520235283
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,which update frequently,1520235287
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,or maybe use something based off of same base distroy,1520235301

And you are talking about wine most of the times it stopped automatically while you running heavy software. And at the time you are editing heavy file your system stop responding.

Love for Linux is good but being a stupid doctor is lead to disaster. Ye to wohi baat hui h mera sir dard h par doctor sahab bol rahe h paracetamol lelo kyunki unhe paracetamol hi dena aata h.

Yes you can achieve more with Adobe Suite, this is because they are suite and not a set of separate tools.
And that doctor thing, think of paracetamol as Photoshop and the usecases for most of the people as head ache, my statement earlier will make much more of a sense.

Do I purge or rm to uninstall a application that I previously installed?

For example, i installed something named powertop (to save battery , through apt-get) 
So to uninstall it , I did purge and I guess I removed it. But I wasn't sure what's the difference between purge and rm, and wasn't able to make it clear via google. Hence, I asked this question. What exactly is the difference between them?",1520313617
Piyush,Malhotra,Piyushmalhotra,"Ohhkaayy got it , and when do I used rm?",1520313643

Aditya,Agrawal,adityaagrawal,Or a file,1520313664
Aditya,Agrawal,adityaagrawal,To remove a non empty directory you can use -rf options with rm,1520313687

I'm stuck on a little issue , how to change the default step size of brightness values",1521079553
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,"I'm using i3wm , and manjaro 17.1.6",1521079584
Kuntal,M,hellozee,how are you changing brightness?,1521079621
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,Using the brightness keys,1521079640
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,I want to do that using the keys only,1521079651
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,"I could go and change the brightness values through cli , 
But i am not able to find how the key binding is done",1521079687
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,I guess there they would have written the default step size,1521079709
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"on terminal try
which xbacklight",1521079814
Kuntal,M,hellozee,ohh,1521079839
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"the brightness keys are most probably called XF86BrightnessUp or something around that, you can find that using xev and then just bindsym that key with xbacklight",1521079958
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,I do not have xbacklight,1521080011
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,🤗,1521080020

yash,,imyashbhardwaj,Ignore typos and systax errors,1521080107
Kuntal,M,hellozee,ohh then wait I have a script which can simulate xbacklight,1521080110
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,Why is xbacklight needed,1521080127
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,Isn't it an additional software ?,1521080139
Kuntal,M,hellozee,,1521080180
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"use this
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec xbacklight -inc 5
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec xbacklight -dec 5
change the xbacklight to the name of the script and values according to your need",1521080308
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,Thanks,1521080888

PROBLEM: high cpu usage while using browser ( used by web content process on mozilla, and chrome-type-render on chrome). Fan usually makes some noise with cpu usages ranging between 40%-80%, while temperature is around 60° on task like uploading txt file to drive, or while viewing videos even on 480p or browsing google.
I tried solutions like updating graphic driver , removing all the browser plugins and re-installing the browsers after clearing the previous data.
Any solutions for this?
(Usage goes high only when browser is used)
PS: I have already tried googling.

Personal Projects - @hellozee's cook or @tk_sourabh's Flask application. Any projects made by community members can be featured here. If it is good enough, make some good first issues for beginners to tackle.

Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"Basically every CPU has peripheral known as timer, which is generally size of CPU word size, say 64 bit , so it can count upto that value and sets the timer flag which is monitored by program . Also the timer has clock which can be independent to system or CPU clock, it can has prescalor value which again depends on architecture which allows to count slow and more 

Basic delay generation you can do with loops if you know exactly how many clock cycle it takes to execute one statement 

for(int i=0; i<value;i++); 

Value is decided by no of clock cycles to generate specific delay! However this is not applicable for generic non real time systems thus timers are helpful! Also RTC in system is not very accurate it runs on 32.768khz frequency because of quartz harmonics resonance this is impacted by temperature.",1523272246

Sometimes setting up env for compilation can be a pain. So we can provide docker images for the same. [The docker image would contain all the build tools and qemu].

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Hey. Debian people. I'm trying to move to elementary OS. So basically debian. But one thing that's holding me back is setting up vim on debian. On my arch linux system, I have a list of packages from the arch repo's that I can just pacman -S and I've got my setup ready (and a short vimrc). How do I find the debian alternatives to those packages? I love using vim, but hate setting it up.

Here's the list of arch linux packages: https://gitlab.com/cocoa1231/dotfiles/blob/master/vim_requirements",1523456539
Kuntal,M,hellozee,actually you could just avoid the extra packges if you just use vundle/pathogen instead of pulling from arch repos,1523456646
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, but I tried and couldn't really get it to work. It was just way easier to do pacman -S $(cat vim_requirements), so I never bothered to do anything",1523456686
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And I also got those packages by doing a regex search on the arch repost. Just did vim-* and got a decent vim setup :P,1523456708
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Removed some bloat I didn't want and that was it,1523456718

These are fixed for VBox, your system should support equivalent or higher.

2. For UGA
#VBoxManage setextradata 'VName' VBoxInternal2/UgaHorizontalResolution 1440

#VBoxManage setextradata 'VName' VBoxInternal2/UgaVerticalResolution 1440

These are part of VirtualBox internals. I use them for my virtual machines..

Sandeep,Kr,,https://www.madresistor.com/libreplot/,1525085847
Sandeep,Kr,,https://gitlab.com/madresistor/libreplot/,1525085890
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You mention in the README.md that other plotting libraries could not satisfy your demands. Can you be more specfic as to what those demands were?,1525087307
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-integrate-a-Python-code-in-the-Android-Java-app

You can run matplotlib or something on server side and use a simple plotting or image creating library to update the canvas on the android device (recieving instructions from the server)",1525087393
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That way you can have more resource intensive stuff running on the server and all the mobile device has to do is create an image.,1525087423
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Something like that,1525087427
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But you can't make it offline then,1525087445
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,I'd rather use GPU backed local plotting than relying on finicky server side tooling,1525087490
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"But matplotlib is well supported, has a shit ton of functions, and recreating a library like that would be like reinventing the wheel. Why do so much work when you can rely on pre existing, well supported and test libraries that already exist?",1525087566
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Again, just using matplotlib as an example. Not tied to that module",1525087586
Kuldeep Singh,Dhaka,kuldeepdhaka,"1. Other libraries were abstracting GPU so much that there was loss of efficiency. Better can be done.
2. Not all run on phones (OpenGLES)
3. Some libraries were specific to a toolkit
4. I couldn't find anything that was in C and OpenGLES",1525087639
Kuldeep Singh,Dhaka,kuldeepdhaka,(Things that I can recall at the moment),1525087659
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But all of those can be fixed by using a server-client model with the server doing the computation and using something like the Python Imaging Library to draw the pictures,1525087708
cocoa,,cocoa1231,On the device,1525087716
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"If I had to just create something like this, I'd go for a kivy+PIL+server stack or something. But that's just me using python. Any similar stack would work",1525087760
Kuldeep Singh,Dhaka,kuldeepdhaka,"1. There is no server here
2. User need to interact with graph",1525087797
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,"1) relying on a server just to draw a graph is an unsustainable approach unless you get everybody to host their own copy, which again is not convenient.
2) This is 2018, phones have GPUs decent enough to render graphs",1525087824
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Why move processing to the cloud for no reason but to move it,1525087842
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hm. Okay. I guess that makes sense. But I'm talking about moving it to a server because we don't have a graphing library powerful enough on android,1525087889

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Oh. As far as I understand it, it's to create a chroot environment, right?",1525163951
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And don't you have to have an installed system to chroot into?,1525163973
Kuntal,M,hellozee,ahh no,1525163996
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You can chroot into an ISO?,1525164009
Kuntal,M,hellozee,I can just untar the gentoo base install and chroot into it,1525164015
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Talking about hamara linux. It doesn't have a stage-n tarball,1525164049
Kuntal,M,hellozee,aww,1525164078
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hehe. Most distros do not,1525164085
.,,rajudev,you can debootstrap a system through the debootstrap command and gives you a base system which you can use as u want.,1525164126
cocoa,,cocoa1231,So it creates something like a container?,1525164150
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I'll just try it out,1525164153
.,,rajudev,container's are something which got built up on top of chroots,1525164174
.,,rajudev,https://wiki.hamaralinux.org/wiki/index.php/Notes_from_Hamara_Sugam_Contributor_IRC_Session_29/12/15,1525164180

Chirag,Sehra,ChiragSehra,My wifi driver is not working. Should I send output of lspci?,1525164210
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, I get the idea. What I'm asking is that when you create a debootstrap env, it has to download the filesystem na?",1525164235
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yes please,1525164240
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And which OS you are on,1525164245
.,,rajudev,"yes, that is the basic operation of debootstrap",1525164272
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah. So that's what I was asking. Can you do it through just extracting the squashfs filesystem?,1525164293
cocoa,,cocoa1231,If you already have the ISO,1525164297
.,,rajudev,"you can, but the debootstrap is much easier and cleaner.",1525164323
Chirag,Sehra,ChiragSehra,18.04 Xubuntu,1525164328
.,,rajudev,The ISO might be old.,1525164330
.,,rajudev,but the debootstrap will always be the latest,1525164342
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah. I was just wondering if the squashfs is the rootfs.tar.gz. I wanted to know if they're the same thing,1525164365
.,,rajudev,they are. debootstrap is a cleaner way/approach,1525164450
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Ohkay. So debootstrap is like pacstrap. It downloads the rootfs into a target directory,1525164476

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Okay this is becoming a concerning trend in this community. While it is true that people should Google before asking, it's also very discouraging to tell people to RTFM or ""just Google it"". This is supposed to be a welcome community for all questions, from the trivial, which elicit the LMGTFY response, to the intriguing ones which have still not been solved (why does yes behave so fucking weirdly @tk_sourabh?!), and telling people to just go and google it isn't helpful. Solve that person's query, and then tell them how to ask better. That's how people learn. That's how communities grow. Just because it's trivial to you, does not mean it's trivial to the person asking",1526842323
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Telling people to look it up discourages them to even speak up and ask the questions, just because of the humiliation they might suffer. And then they'll just give up on Linux. The community is there to help. You put in the effort, and the community will help you back",1526842468
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"We should borrow LCI's motto. Be polite, be helpful",1526842523
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Me currently :P,1526842754
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1526842754
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Thx @cocoa1231,1526843158
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"I don't think asking someone to search is rude or humiliating in some way, though LMGTFY is somewhat.
Solve that person's query, and then tell them how to ask better.
In other words solving their problem and saying them that you just could have searched it, sounds like some kind of humiliation.
A trivial question is not always equivalent to a First Link Answer Question, we are community not a customer support.
At least from a developer or someone who studies computer science, I wouldn't expect a FLA question, if he/she is not computer person, then the thing is different.",1526843472
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"@hellozee its not the case, Okay for me, I feel really bad whenever i ask something, in group, because i know there are many people in group who knows a lot more than me, and what i get in return is a google link, if i had to do it, then why should be i. In a community,? Google helps me and thats it,",1526843626
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,I never feel motivated to use linux except because of few people's who help me whenever i get stuck,1526843650
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, but that's just your perspective na? I won't name names, but I've talked to a lot of people from this community who have felt this and then stopped asking. And you're right. We're not customer support. But we are a community who want to endorse Linux. Who want to promote Linux. And if you feel like FLA questions are too simple and should be answered by Google, then that's fine. You can tell the person politely. And if you can, solve their query. If not, no one's asking you to. That's the key difference between this and customer support. You don't have to answer. But we do answer because we want that person to have a good experience with Linux.",1526843747
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"I know my question are sometimes stupid, But yeah i don't know about systems, and it breaks whenever i try to do something, i figure out what i breaking it and next time something or other breaks it. So, i think someone who is more experienced can help me, Today my mint system broked, but i didn't asked anyone why its, Morning i sended a msg and a clip, and no one helped me out, so i stopped asking about it,",1526843796
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,My opinion on the matter: let's not be Stack Overflow,1526843829

Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Also jeez wall of texts,1526843854
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hehe,1526843860
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"Well i read somewhere a software person is a guy who knows how to use google and stack overflow 😅 and come on friends were just pulling your leg, it happened to all of us 😉, IMO googling is an art and you should learn to do it, try helping yourself ! Community forums should be your last resort! Again that’s my personal opinion....",1526844839
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,"Something to support the art of googling which I totally agree to 

https://twitter.com/vipulgupta2048/status/988827280334979073?s=19",1526845668
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yes, but that just pulling your leg part is very subtle, and most people don't get it. Espcially newbies who don't know the inside-jokes of a community. And yeah, googling is an art, and they should learn how to do it, so how about we teach it to them? And as far as community forums being your last resort is for communities who get so big that they have to use the stratigy. We aren't that big. That's the whole point of these local communities. 

When LUGs started, they used to be fest-like events where people would literally wheel in their computers so that the neck beards could take a look and help people out. And that's the whole idea! To create a space for people who don't know how to google, or what to google, to ask their questions. 

If you feel like the question is easily answerable with a google search, say something like Try searching <search text>. Someone else want to elaborate on this?. You should teach the person how to ask questions without making them feel like they're asking something dumb. And to be honest, I know people say there is no such thing as a dumb question, and mostly you brush it off as something people say, but I've found it to be the case that I have leared a bunch while trying to help someone.",1526845687

vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,Do tell what you think.,1526887862
AJ,,ajnsit,On macs you can simply copy over the qcow file to recover the containers. I presume there’s a similar file/folder for docker on linux,1526888289
AJ,,ajnsit,"Btw if you are not able to recover your containers from Dockerfiles, you are using docker wrong",1526888331
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,I was using docker for packaging and stuffs,1526888372
Akash,Mishra,akash47,"/var/lib/docker. If this directory is intact, then copy this folder to your current /var/lib. Remember to stop the docker service before copying.",1526888489
AJ,,ajnsit,The point is that ideally you should br making any changes you need to the dockerfiles instead of sshing into a running container and making them manually,1526888535
AJ,,ajnsit,So you can always recreate containers,1526888571

Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,"At my office we are exploring different options of setting up our test enviornment. What would you guys suggest would be the best approach - buying our own hardware and setting up a server in our office or getting it from a provider like Digital ocean, aws.  Server configuration that we are considering is 12 core processer(s), 28-32 GB memory, 3TB+ Harddisk, OS -  Fedora. Stack - Django, Angular, SOLR, Redis, Nginx",1527165806
jayant,,gamezgeek,"@gouravchawla the question that you need to answer is whether you want your dev environment to work when internet is not working. If the answer is yes, you need to have a local hardware setup.",1527166561
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,"I'm assuming that internet won't be an issue. We therefore are not considering that variable. And to answer your question, no we don't want offline access for this environment. Every developer has the local enviorment setup which takes care of that.",1527166946
jayant,,gamezgeek,In that case aws makes a lot of sense. As you will be able to provision hardware as required.,1527167034

Philomath,,miphilomath,"Hi @iamchauhan, how about an introduction?",1527394567
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,"Long time linux user, sys admin, network admin. I started when linux was just catching up and they gave a free CD with the Digit magzine. Linux ver 0.93 or so. I didnt have a CD drive or even a comp at that time , but the very idea of a free CD was out of this world then, atleast in india. back in early 90s. I ve extensively worked on the linux kernel networking stack optimizing and fine tunning the TCP algos within. Other than linux I have a decent view of the security landscape. However, I dont have a public github repository, or CVEs to my name. or any public visibility, so take everything with a pinch of salt 😉 most familiar with ubuntu and debian. last worked on redhat side with fedora 18-ish. Dont know emacs. Fan of Vi. Dont care about the desktop environment. havent used any other shell than BASH. havent coded much. have read a lot of code. etc etc !",1527396137
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,how's that for an intro? :-|,1527396161
AJ,,ajnsit,"“Don’t know emacs, fan of vi” - try spacemacs. It changed my life",1527396389
Philomath,,miphilomath,That is a great intro :),1527396431
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,"The only expusure to emacs is the key bindings I have used for command line editing in bash. I thought i was too old to learn new tricks, but I will try spacemacs if it is life changing 😊 Will let you know how it turned out.",1527396747
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"wow, another kernel dev in the group",1527396854
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,"That would be stretching it, but yea, I am kind a familiar with the network stack.",1527396890
AJ,,ajnsit,“The only expusure to emacs is the key bindings I have used for command line editing in bash” - you can use vi keybindings with ‘set -o vi’,1527396907
AJ,,ajnsit,Another life changing setting 😀,1527396929
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,last looked at the kernel code was with ver 2.6 or something.,1527396936
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,Ive tried this  and I thought I would like it. but some how switching context is something that i try to avoid. say i dont have my sytem at hand but need to work on someone else's station. all my speed and optimization would be gone.,1527397016
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,I had also tried an extension for firefox that makes vi shortcuts work within the browser and you dont need to touch the mouse. but that was more for fun rather than efficiency. turned out okay for a while. until i switched back to the mouse because it feels more natural.,1527397086

.,,rajudev,what is better and why?,1527789723
.,,rajudev,"I know it depends on use cases, but what is better in your use case?",1527789753
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,different purposes different strokes. cms based is better if your use case is a dynamic one. showing different stuff to different poeple.,1527789775
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,"static generators, if you have simple content and want a fast and secure site.",1527789799
.,,rajudev,I have used wordpress and Blogger both previously. Been using Jekyll now.,1527789842
.,,rajudev,"Is it that static site generators are good, but they reduce the blogging frequency.",1527789874
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,the frequency depends solely on you.,1527789926
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,As you would understand wordpress is the non troubles ever platform. I use that.,1527789975
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,"Right, now I have it on www.mixstersite.wordpress.com",1527789995
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,Will be shifting to .org soon.,1527790007
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,Blogging freq depends on you. I do it once a week now because gsoc. Otherwise once a month.,1527790042
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,"With static generators, like pelican. The hassle is setup. If you can write as fast in markdown as in plain text then okay.",1527790083
.,,rajudev,I have got well versed about writing in markdown now. The issue starts when I have to include images and other media. They could be easily added but requires fiddling with paths and names.,1527790313
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,"True, also i feel like markdown should include support for videos and media formatting. Like allow atleast some HTML",1527790490
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,"With wordpress, I can churn out blogs in 20 minutes if I have a clear idea.",1527790553

Aditya,,adityamalla1990,alright...,1527851521
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,can you point out some sources where I can learn build these drivers?,1527851542
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,"mainly i2C, SPI and CAN",1527851561
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Build as in make ?,1527851580
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,yeah..,1527851590
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,You understand the protocol functioning?,1527851593
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"i2C, SPI mainly can vary SoC to SoC",1527851628
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Some has one others have two buses,1527851635
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,So you can cross compile and handle buses on device tree level,1527851656
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,alright.. but the basic development arch would be the same.,1527851665
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Yeah,1527851679
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Try writing a makefile for linux kernel i2c driver,1527851710
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,cross compiling linux for target hardware and developing these drivers on target system itself can also work right,1527851750
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,As kernel objects yes,1527851766
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,as the port addresses can be  easily located.. or else then you always have the data sheets,1527851780
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,But it is recommended to have a toll chain setup on native build host and build it alongside kernel,1527851794
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,To avoid fingerprints mismatch kind errors,1527851805
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,okay.. so from where do I start?,1527851845
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,resources?,1527851849
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,toolchain setup,1527851865
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,What target you are building for ?,1527851872
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Do you plan on using any build framework?,1527851887
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Like yocto or buildroot?,1527851902
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,x86 and ARM both,1527851941
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,so what I plan to do is use the gpio ports of old x86 systems,1527851963
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,like Intel core 2 duo 2008 model..,1527851977
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,do they have i2c controller or you want to use gpios and make one by bit-banging?,1527852000
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,"and then configure GPIO ports into parallel, serial and then further SPI",1527852001
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,for SPI I will use TI 16658 controller..,1527852036
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"I am curious , How are you planning to test it ?",1527852043
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,pretty much a retro stuff,1527852048
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Do keep in mind threshold levels,1527852053
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,There might be different logic levels from cpu,1527852067
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,yes of course...,1527852067
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,I cant recall any resources,1527852093
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,I started by learning functioning of these protocols,1527852103
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,as a concept... il try to interface another controller with it,1527852106
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,For i2c you need to assign address to that controller or in some cases it should have its own,1527852138
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,so you eventually developed these on those SCULL driver architecture..,1527852139
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,these*,1527852142
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,i2c.. more like later on...,1527852158
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,want to gwt into SPI first,1527852169
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,A good way to test is to use a logic analyzer,1527852172
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Like Salae,1527852172
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,well I have those cheap ass logic analyzers .. lol,1527852199
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,will they do the trick?,1527852211
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,24mhz 8 channel,1527852217
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,😅,1527852223
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,I think these intel chipset boards do have all the peripherals,1527852384
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,for instance a flash is connected via SPI which has the bare metal code or the BIOS,1527852456
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,tbh.. no hands on yocto,1527852494
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,buildroot easy to use... but more like cross compiling the kernel manually and then configuring the gui,1527852533
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,however.. gui is not that important.. if I am just developing the code on host machine and testing it on target system..,1527852573

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: Harsh Shandilya: you can choose themes I guess,1528019801
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Then you can't compare it with Github,1528019802
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,you want to compare software with a service,1528019811

Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,"If it's a service, it should work for what it's supposed to",1528020018

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,pavi: He has done not only packaging it but also teaching and bringing more people into packaging by organising workshops.,1528020517
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,pavi: Guess what the result of the hardwork is? Yesterday I upgraded from Jess gitlab from praveen repo ro Stretch in Debian repo using apt Dist upgrade and guess what it was butter smooth 👌,1528020625
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: pavi: I guess we need to do some more testing before  announcing it,1528020680
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,pavi: Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen That was about the old 8.13 version not the 10.x,1528021588

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,pavi: For others gitlab 8.13 ---> 10.x is a MAJOR upgrade. Its almost getting ready.  New gitlab has lot and lot of javascript dependencies which praveen and team have packaged.,1528021934

Dhanesh,Sabane,dhanesh95,That's another option! 👍🏼,1528026455
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,"GitHub is a service, you don't compare services to software just because you can. Gitlab as a software might be amazing, but gitlab.com as a service has always been a disappointment.",1528026487
Dhanesh,Sabane,dhanesh95,But isn't an instance of the software a service? So won't you consider framagit.org a service?,1528026597

Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,It's framagit,1528026619
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Just like every forum hosted using phpBB is a entity in itself and not phpBB,1528026665

Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,I never said it's not a service,1528028712
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Gitlab as a service would be gitlab.com only,1528028728
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: or how is each of them not a service, just because there are more services using the same software?",1528028729
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: wrong,1528028740
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: any server running gitlab software can be service,1528028776
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: some of these can be private and some can be public,1528028781
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: you are limiting yourself,1528028805
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: like how a frong in a well claiming there can be no ocean only wells,1528028819
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,This is again software versus service,1528028929

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: no you are just refusing to accept facts,1528028953
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,pavi: Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen Please dont waste your time with people who are big time fans of centralised services.,1528028977
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: you can say gitlab.com is not as reliable,1528028978
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: but that does not mean there can be no other gitlab service which are more reliable,1528029007
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: I did not say gitlab.com is more reliable than github.com,1528029055
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: but saying only gitlab.com qualify as a gitlab service is false,1528029075
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,If you tell a GitHub user to migrate to gitlab they'll go to gitlab.com not any of the hundreds of self hosted copies,1528029114
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,And they'll be disappointed.,1528029118
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,gitlab.com as a service does not inspire any faith and mars whatever impression you'd have of gitlab itself,1528029159
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: I have experience of telling people to sign up at git.fosscommunity.in,1528029172
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: I agree with that,1528029205
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: that is where it being Free software matters,1528029221
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: because then we are not mercy of gitlab.com admins,1528029239
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: we can run our own instance and we do that at git.fosscommunity.in,1528029284
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,"I know, I already said the ability to self host is gitlab winning as a software but as a service it has always been disappointing and has put off too many people like myself.",1528029306
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: its a bit old version, but it works pretty reliable (we do have downtimes at times too, since its volunteer run we may not be as quick to respond)",1528029309
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"[for sake of moderating]
pls don't put up assumptions.",1528031182
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: Harsh Shandilya: that is because you assume there can be only one (or there should be only one) service for a software.,1528031594
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: because most of the services you are familiar with have only one provider,1528031605
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,If the organisation which writes the software can't host a usable copy of it then lack of confidence is justified.,1528031644
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: if Airtel has bad coverage in your home? Would you say mobile is bad? gitlab.com is just one the many gitlab services out there,1528031648
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: Harsh Shandilya: it is their priorities too,1528031697
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: they may want people to pay for a better service,1528031697
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: I think the downtimes are mostly because of their philosophy, not incompetence",1528031721
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: they want to update their software every month,1528031742
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: which is not the case with github.com or any traditional software/service,1528031746
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: so when you change something, that often it is bound to have problems",1528031769
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: would you say fedora being bleeding edge is a bad thing for Red hat as a company?,1528031784
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: I think with gitlab.com, they want to show case the features as soon as it is available",1528031822
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: so they push rc versions on gitlab.com even before it is final release,1528031838
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: gitlab.com to their paid/managed hosting is like Fedora vs RHEL,1528031905
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: people understand that,1528031913
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: and they have many paying customers,1528031922
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: git.fosscommunity.in don't change often, we don't have a feature update for years",1528031967
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: so its stable but lack latest features,1528031972
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Praveen: the problem with gitlab.com is developers taking the place of traditional sys admins,1528032046

Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,"Hello,

To all the community members.

As the organizers of PyCon India have confirmed that there will be community booths, so we can have one for ILUG-D too.

We could have ILUG-D t-shirts for members of the community that would manage the booth or for people in the community who are attending PyCon India to show the presence of ILUG-D and can even get ILUG-D's swag like stickers, badges, t-shirts or anything printed for distribution to the attendees as well as for the upcoming ILUG-D's birthday on 8-oct as we complete 2 years as a community.

Any further suggestions or help would be appreciated.

So for instance, if I have a pointer to an object called p1, I'll first have to dereference it, and then access it's method, say foo. So the syntax would be (*p1).foo(). The -> does this in one shot, so the earlier statement is equivilent to p1->foo()",1528726948

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"True. Recent Nvidia update left some GPUs broken, thus not allowing Xorg to start. Had to downgrade to the nvidia-900 package",1528824957
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Which one of the NVIDIA GPUs are you using?,1528825050
Kuntal,M,hellozee,I think you can restrict someone/everyone to add you to any group in Telegram,1528825277
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Nvidia GeForce GT 705,1528825278
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I used the Nvidia package normally,1528825285
Shashikanth Reddy,Palvatla,shashikanth171,Yes but it is not so by default,1528825294
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But that package stopped supporting my gpu,1528825298

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Dunno,1528825960

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Could you switch between the two? Like, make the system ignore the GPU and use the CPU for graphics processing?",1528826085
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I think if you rmmod the nvidia and nouveau drivers it should fall back on the CPU for graphics processing,1528826119
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"In Laptop yes, in desktop umm I don't think so, you can just unplug your GPU",1528826125
Kuntal,M,hellozee,*that yes kinda depends how well your Distro supports nvidia optimus,1528826154
Kuntal,M,hellozee,or you need to use bumblebee,1528826159
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,How? To do that pls tell,1528826174
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I'm sure there's a kernel-level method to do this,1528826175

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hm. Okay. I'll see how it works for desktops then,1528826339
Kuntal,M,hellozee,As far as I know this is only supported in Ubuntu,1528826341
Kuntal,M,hellozee,using the nvidia-prime package,1528826353
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,See something for AMD too pls @cocoa1231,1528826430
Kuntal,M,hellozee,amd already supports everything,1528826446
Kuntal,M,hellozee,I mean amd is better supported than nvidia in linux,1528826462
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Okay. I think you should be able to do it. What happens if you block the pci device associated with the gpu?,1528826462
Kuntal,M,hellozee,the vga/hdmi cable runs through your GPU probably,1528826496
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"if you block that pci port, your monitor goes blank",1528826541
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"There has to be a method to do it which doesn't rely on the GPU, but just the kernel",1528826647
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Imma keep looking,1528826652

Snap are being stored in /var/lib/snapd by default and since I alloted only 5GB for /var, it is being filled easily.
I want to move the applications installed via snap to somewhere else with more space like home dir.
I googled and found a way but the doubt I have is
How do I make Home dir default location for installing snap? and shall I? (since snap is already storing user data in home)
TIA",1528915712

Philomath,,miphilomath,"Oh, i think it goes deeper than that. Found about n loop antenna. Let me search more and then come back later",1529178449
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"Not necessary, lambda/4 is when you want to do a quarter wave impedence matching which is prefered because of 4 stable harmonic wrt gnd plane. But it depends on lot of orher thing as well like type of antenna, coax diameter, centre frequency etc",1529178537
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,2.4Ghz wifi is not exactly 2.4 it has different channels so router antenna length is calculated from band centre frequency,1529178575
Philomath,,miphilomath,Any pointer on the specifics?,1529178770
Philomath,,miphilomath,So that i can read more about it,1529178786
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,I’ll share tomorrow!,1529178810
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,I had a couple of research papers I reffered during my undergrad while designing an antenna,1529178838
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,You know what,1529178857
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,You can alter antenna length by changing capacitance and inductance on rf circuit as well 😅,1529178882
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"So it’s quiet complicated, no wonder RF engineers are paid so damn well...",1529178912

nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,I was looking for key point because I have gone through many article on this but still I have some confusion left.,1531074020
nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,But if there was no FOSS then the existence of OSS would also not be there.,1531074091
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Kisne bola,1531074113
Ilugd-Bot,,ilugd_bot,Hello Cyber! Welcome to ILUG-D .Please introduce yourself.,1531074115

.,,rajudev,"everyone has there own opinions, based on there experiences, learnings and Understandings around them.",1531074178
.,,rajudev,not in all cases.,1531074195
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"OSS -> The Source code  of the Software is available to all.
FOSS -> A subset of OSS where the software is both open source and free.
FLOSS -> A subset of FOSS where the source code of the program can be modified and can be distributed in your own terms.",1531074200
Kuntal,M,hellozee,This is what I have understood,1531074208
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Yeah thats true,1531074212
.,,rajudev,give the source for free. not the service.,1531074212
nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,https://opensource.com/article/17/11/open-source-or-free-software,1531074413
nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,@hellozee according to this article FOSS came first then how it can be subset of OSS.,1531074470
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Why can't be it?,1531074485
nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,FOSS was originated first then OSS came to existence,1531074526
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"FOSS originated first, then some people decide lets sell our software, hence they removed the F, :P",1531074965
.,,rajudev,FOSS can also be sold.,1531075014
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"A better analogy,
Our ancestors knew what is solar system, it is after solar system we discoverd Milky Way, but our solar system is a subset of Milky Way",1531075060
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Only Service,1531075074
nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,so in brief FOSS means freedom to work and collaborate where the product is free,1531075074
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Isn't the Free in FOSS NOT about payment 🤔,1531075090
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"That's where the confusion lies, many people consider FOSS == FLOSS, but I beg to differ, :P",1531075137

nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,also the license is same for both of them,1531075236
nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,"yes ,but in FOSS we can do it",1531075250
Kuntal,M,hellozee,@nightwarrior_xxx,1531075270
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"According to me and some people, you can only do that in FLOSS, but according to some you can do it in FOSS",1531075305
nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,Article says which a psted above you can modify and share in FOSS and everything is free,1531075356
nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,But is OSS only the code is open source,1531075387

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Unfortunately Free the word has lots of meanings in the context of Free Software it has to be taken in the terms of Freedom,1531121904
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Foss the term was coined to accomodate both the idealogies of Free software and Open source,1531121978
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"not correct they are all the terms people came up with in order to explain to masses What Free and Open Source is all about , since the L in FLOSS means Libre it was dropped since not many folks understood its meaning too then the word Foss came into being",1531122255
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Both of you are not correct 😊,1531122364
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"No its about users freedom to share , copy and recreate read more about the four freedoms Free software has to offer in order to become Free Software",1531122465
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,The Subset superset analogy is not correct,1531122540
Kuntal,M,hellozee,ohh 😅,1531122855
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Ahh, probably I somewhere read that many people still consider FLOSS different from FOSS",1531122925

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Difference between ?,1531123058
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,afaik there is no difference except the Libre word,1531123105
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,I think this is a good read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software,1531123224
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Ask me anything if anyone has questions in the article we can explore together,1531123291
Guneet,,guneetnarula,"Terms may come and go, it's the values that matter",1531123316
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"What would you call Qt then? 
Essentially it is free and open source but without a commercial license you can't redistribute Qt under your own name, with your own patches. The Open Source license forces you make your patches for framework, available to the upstream.

I am quoting this from https://www1.qt.io/qt-licensing-terms/
Complete corresponding source code of the library used with the application or the device built using LGPL, including all modifications to the library, should be delivered with the application (or alternatively provide a written offer with instructions on how to get the source code). It should be noted that the complete corresponding source code has to be delivered even if the library has not been modified at all.",1531123823
Guneet,,guneetnarula,"It's FOSS for users who want to further develop FOSS applications. Similar to ""share alike"" under Creative Commons.",1531124057
Sahil,,warlord77,But they affect you when you build a commercial grade product and ignore them,1531124120
Guneet,,guneetnarula,You are referring to licensing then. Yes that matters a whole lot,1531124150
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Following the licensing terms the next one,  it says: 

In case of dynamic linking, it is possible, but not mandatory, to keep application source code proprietary as long as it is “work that uses the library” – typically achieved via dynamic linking of the library. In case of static linking of the library, the application itself may no longer be “work that uses the library” and thus become subject to LGPL. It is recommended to either link dynamically, or provide the application source code to the user under LGPL.

I am writing an application which uses Qt5.10 and above, which still not available for most of the distros, so can't distribute using distro based packages(.deb,.rpm). Upto now I was thinking of distributing it as an Appimage which is distro agnostic, but here comes the problem, appimages are statically linked and my project uses the zlib license, does that mean I should be using the Commercial license?",1531124190
Guneet,,guneetnarula,Interesting. What's the zlib license?,1531124336
Kuntal,M,hellozee,https://www.zlib.net/zlib_license.html,1531124389
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"Licenses are like land mines unfortunately we need one in the FOSS world as well , get in touch with organizations like SFLC.in when in doubt",1531124455
Guneet,,guneetnarula,Was going to suggest sflc only.,1531124495
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Could we have a session or panel discussion from some of you on this topic in one of the upcoming meetups?,1531124528
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"Sure we can have one again depends on the number of people who are interested , may be i can ask SFLC to host one meeting in there premises itself",1531124593
Guneet,,guneetnarula,"According to this, you can use zlib in your application, with a clear acknowledgement of zlib.h (Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler). You could have a third party software credits section",1531124606
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Thanks,1531124622
Guneet,,guneetnarula,"But when it comes to QT, i am not sure, haven't used it myself. If it is technically not possible to use their LGPL version then I guess you have no choice",1531124726

nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,@Satyaakam  @guneetnarula  Can you explain once again difference between FOSS and OSS?,1531134145
nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,Actually I am confused with them so I just want key points to make my concept clear about them,1531134200
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"if you go by the terms FOSS is a neutral term where folks wants to mention about Free software as well , Free software apart from the software is a social movement ,OSS on the other hand took all the software from free software and the emphasis is more on the software development methodology",1531134934
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,in OSS we also pass on the Freedoms Free Software talks about but its not explicit in many ways,1531135018
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,the whole OSS word came into being because the business and normal folks were confused with the Free word,1531135065
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,again read this to understand the models https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar,1531135103
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,So bottom line when we mention FOSS we are acknowledging both the camps,1531135274

           Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in place. This option,
           when used with install/remove, can omit any packages to permit APT to deduce a
           likely solution. If packages are specified, these have to completely correct the
           problem. The option is sometimes necessary when running APT for the first time;
           APT itself does not allow broken package dependencies to exist on a system. It is
           possible that a system's dependency structure can be so corrupt as to require
           manual intervention (which usually means using dpkg --remove to eliminate some of
           the offending packages). Use of this option together with -m may produce an error

Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Topic suggestion for Panel discussion:

PyDelhi had a very fruitful discussion with IDE vs editors where things lead to discussions about. `Code Quality`.

How about

 ""Collaboration in  open source/communities""

Talking points could be

  - Importance of code quality(doc-strings,  linters, pep8/Flake8 type Styleguides ).
  - Social skills and working in teams, how different projects manage this differently...
  - Using just zips and emailing code to each other vs Version Management git/svn...
  - Code of Conduct and Task lists for every one, how to make every one feel part of the community
  - CI/CD tests builds releases and deployments, Why, How(Buildbot vs Travis vs others).
  - Social tasks around communities, importance of volunteers who help design Posters, Social Media  posts,
  - People who volunteer to help in developer sprints and to teach and guide others.",1532359947

Raman,Tehlan,ramantehlan,"Before anyone judges, I will also like to tell my side of the story.
——————
As we all know the mega meetup is coming, so I was excited and already created a poster for it, and to do so I was in touch with @rajataaron ,  I was busy collecting logos and stuff, with which @vipulgupta2048 was helping.

logo for Blockchain dev group was hard to find, so I was told that @Quanon can help me, but instead of sending me a logo, he simply sends me a screenshot, that too had a completely different background overlaid but I still accepted it and decided to edit it to make it better, but it was in bad quality, later I also discovered that It is used by other companies as there logo, so I thought to create a new one, and I posted it in the Blockchain group, with a message.

Then @Quanon asks me to use the screenshot only, so I informed him to provide me with a better quality of logo, to which he said, it is not his job, that it is my job, (It's not a job, I am volunteering), to which I shared a FOSS quote, to keep the conversation healthy. He then asks me to edit it and called me lazy. I created a new logo for the community, which wasn't copied from the internet, like the current one, and yet I was called lazy. I tried explaining to sir, that I Tried editing it, but the result was not good, and it is copied from the internet. But, he again calls me lazy. 

He then told me he created his logo, but I just proved that it is taken from the internet, after which all I know is, I was blocked from pydelhi, Blockchain Dev Group, and he personally blocked me too.


--------------------------

Members, I didn't break any guideline, I was so excited for the meetup, that I asked @vipulgupta2048 for more work for me, but yet, I was blocked without a trial, without any warning. An organizer is also volunteering to follow the guidelines and keep the order, but yet I was throw out as if it is @Quanon company. 

If the community feels that It is my fault, I myself will leave pydelhi, but I want the community to decide that, not just one person, but people.

Thank You for listening to my side.",1532364131

Rajat,Saini,rajataaron,"After reading conversation @ramantehlan you can say it in nice manner. The way of expressing of words on message is more difficult then talking. I have worked with @Quanon many times. 

Just want to clarify respecting others is all I know. @ramantehlan your intention was not wrong but way of expressing may be. So consider this as a warning and @Quanon please unban @ramantehlan from groups give him a chance to volunteer again. I will talk to @ramantehlan.",1532364626

P.S he didn’t sounded lazy to me...",1532364799
Quanon,,Quanon,I did let you know how to do it in ink scape didn’t I,1532364814

Raman,Tehlan,ramantehlan,"I don't lie, the best thing about community is, we can all agree to disagree, and yet work together.

I try to create the best thing for everyone, the only reason I asked for a better logo was the same.

I will do things systematically and will raise a PR for a new logo.

Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,sorry little lazy to google,1532952768
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,IMO since all ntp clients are 32-bit compatible this issue will persist,1532953028
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"I just checked with an engineer working on ntp here


even if you are using a 64-bit system the design flaw will still be there because the NTP protocol itself propagates time information with too small a time range as the time is relative.


My understanding is that one solution is to prevent the system time starting at 1970 (start of current UNIX Epoch) by setting system time to the build time.

I have not looked at your code snippet, so perhaps there is an additional issue there in the implementation. But anyway, NTP itself needs special treatment (or new NTP protocol design) to work across the boundary between UNIX Epochs.

Does that help ?

Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,"I don't know whats the big deal with 3d printed weapons. Guns etc, are not too complex to build anyway. there are home made guns all around. At least in india, the common man doesn't own a gun not because it is difficult to build, but because its illegal and its cultural not to have a gun on you at all times. So also with knives. and with tanks. 

The US on the other hand is a different culture. 3d printed gun would lower an entry barrier. But more pertinent is that there are no other strong barriers like cultural and legal. Hence it is drawing widespread attention. 

For that matter, a lot of harmful chemicals, some to be ingested (drugs) others pyro related ( bomb like) which can be easily made. The recipies are all over the net. But it has not been a huge problem as such because of cultural and other non digital aspects of the society.",1533085189

Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,"well first of all, almost nothing goes the right way in Kali (as far as their own docs say ) Its not meant to be used in that way. plus almost any distro can have the features kali has. I find no point using it (sorry I had to shame)",1533732394

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hey guys. We should make a public link for ILUGD too. Like @linuxchixin (t.me/linuxchixin) or @pydelhigroup (t.me/pydelhigroup),1533835492
cocoa,,cocoa1231,It's easier to share,1533835507

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah but I think the growth of LCI versus the number of times it's been spammed (n:1) is worth it,1533836456

Kuntal,M,hellozee,agreed,1533837032
Kuntal,M,hellozee,but that is not because making the group public but because of people like you who are devoting a chunk of their time to it,1533837075
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Fair enough. But I still do think that making a sharable link is better. You can put it up on a screen pretty easily. Imma put up a poll :P,1533837311

1st answer mentioned here didn't work, and in trying out 2nd answer, my *alsa-base pulseaudio* got uninstalled, and not able to reinstall it now. Everytime, I try to re-install it, I get a dependency error to install *libpulse*. And, when trying to install libpulse, I'm again getting dependency errors and not able to find any way out to fix the issue.
I even tried running the commands again after doing: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade. But, it didn't work out and still getting same errors.

Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,"You don't have to trust me on this one haha. I'm not a crypto expert but some people who criticized telegram for its (in)security are and they seem to be 'valid' enough.

    - telegram hardly protects metadata (programs have been written in the past (this goes for WhatsApp as well by the way) which can monitor the off/online going of a user and are able to establish sleep patterns and such based on that data.

    - telegram uses the MTProto crypto protocol/algo. It's based on insecure standards for one but also; why in the living fuck would one write it's own crypto protocol when their are very secure (and actually verified) algo's out there? This makes no fucking sense. (also looking at you, Viber)

    Not a vulnerability or anything *technically* but you have to explicitly *start* an end to end encrypted chat session. That's perfectly fine of course but when you advertise your messenger as an 'encrypted' messenger and the chats aren't encrypted by default, that's very misleading.

I have a query. I hope many of you have done enterprise grade applications. I'm just starting into it and wanted to know how do you guys manage your APIs?

Like do you go for microservices or one monolithic API server?
Right now I'm having an expressjs api server with all the endpoints and I'm using AWS to host it.

Can you guys recommend me scalable solutions for enterprise grade api which can handle maybe like 500-600 req/sec? Any tools, workflow, idea or recommendation? This will be very helpful for me.",1536671269

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Holy shit I missed a sh**show

My two cents on whatever just happened here:

1) For the person asking the question ( @vabhishek_me ), to form a concrete question, tell everyone what technologies for what purpose you're using. Try to be as to-the-point as possible. I would reframe your question like so:

Hey, I'm building an enterprise level API which will provide <insert functionality>, what tips do y'all recommend so that I can scale this service up as I get a larger userbase.

And then add some more details, which I didn't since I don't know much about what you're trying to make.

2) More importantly, to those who are answering the question (@hellozee @arcsaber), instead of changing the technologies they're using or critiquing what they're using, try to first answer what they've asked for. Everyone has opinions on what someone should use to do something, but if everyone just said that Hey, I think you should change your codebase from <something> to <something>, then there would be a thousand posts, none of them answering the OPs question. This happens quite a lot online.

If you do not know the answer, just start out by saying Hey, I'm not sure what the answer is, but I'm curious and then your question. In these situations, the person who's asked the question comes in hoping to get some recommendations or solutions, and goes out rethinking their life's decisions :P Not helpful to anyone.

P.S, this is mainly for new comers who don't know who's who. You can f*** with me or other people you know all you want :P",1536679890

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"So @amarislit, my two cents:

- Everyone here (probably, including @arcsaber ) is aware of the GNU Philosophy, and we often use the word FOSS and Open Source interchangably here. So I feel like you can skip the part about explaining the GNU Philosophy.

- As far as I understand, @arcsaber's confusion comes from the fact that you said that users shouldn't have to rely on any developer at all for their software, but software has to be made by someone, and that someone, by definition, is a developer. So I think you should explain that part to him

And finally, let's keep the conversation polite and respectful toward each other :)",1537030479

After Years of Abusive E-mails, the Creator of Linux Steps Aside

By Noam Cohen

September 19, 2018

￼

After years of verbally abusing programmers who contribute to the Linux operating-system kernel he created, the celebrated coder Linus Torvalds is stepping aside and says he is getting help.

The e-mails of the celebrated programmer Linus Torvalds land like thunderbolts from on high onto public lists, full of invective, insults, and demeaning language. “Please just kill yourself now. The world will be a better place,” he wrote in one. “Guys, this is not a dick-sucking contest,” he observed in another. “SHUT THE FUCK UP!” he began in a third.

Torvalds has publicly posted thousands of scathing messages targeting programmers who submit what he deems flawed code to the Linux computer-operating-system kernel, which he brought to life more than twenty-five years ago and now administers as a collaborative, open-source project. Today, the Linux kernel is famous, running the enormous computers of Google, PayPal, Amazon, and eBay, and the two billion mobile phones using the Android operating system. Torvalds, though, retains final say over each precious line of code, just as he did when he first started working on the system as a graduate student at the University of Helsinki. For years, he has been known as Linux’s “benevolent dictator for life.”

On Sunday, the benevolent dictator announced that he would be stepping down temporarily, to “get some assistance on how to understand people’s emotions and respond appropriately.” Torvalds, who is forty-eight and lives with his family outside Portland, Oregon, made clear that he wasn’t burned out. “I very much do want to continue to do this project that I’ve been working on for almost three decades,” he wrote in a post to the Linux-kernel mailing list. “I need to take a break to get help on how to behave differently and fix some issues in my tooling and workflow.” Torvalds named a deputy, Gregory Kroah-Hartman, to run the project while he was away.

Torvalds’s decision to step aside came after The New Yorker asked him a series of questions about his conduct for a story on complaints about his abusive behavior discouraging women from working as Linux-kernel programmers. In a response to The New Yorker, Torvalds said, “I am very proud of the Linux code that I invented and the impact it has had on the world. I am not, however, always proud of my inability to communicate well with others—this is a lifelong struggle for me. To anyone whose feelings I have hurt, I am deeply sorry.”

Torvalds’s response was conveyed by the Linux Foundation, which supports Linux and other open-source programming projects and paid Torvalds $1.6 million in annual compensation as of 2016. The foundation said that it supported his decision and has encouraged women to participate but that it has little control over how Torvalds runs the coding process. “We are able to have varying degrees of impact on these outcomes in newer projects,” the statement said. “Older more established efforts like the Linux kernel are much more challenging to influence.”

Until this weekend, Torvalds had not only defended his aggressive behavior but insisted that it contributed to Linux’s runaway success. “If you want me to ‘act professional,’ I can tell you that I’m not interested,” he wrote in 2013, in response to a prominent Linux contributor, Sage Sharp, who demanded on a public e-mail list that Torvalds stop using “physical intimidation, verbal threats or verbal abuse” in his e-mails. “I’m sitting in my home office wearign [sic] a bathrobe,” Torvalds wrote. “The same way I’m not going to start wearing ties, I’m also not going to buy into the fake politeness, the lying, the office politics and backstabbing, the passive aggressiveness, and the buzzwords. Because THAT is what ‘acting professionally’ results in: people resort to all kinds of really nasty things because they are forced to act out their normal urges in unnatural ways.”

Although",1537530837
Raghav,,Rwbhu,"it distributes its product for free, the Linux project has grown to resemble a blue-chip tech company. Nominally a volunteer enterprise, like Wikipedia, Linux, in fact, is primarily sustained by funds and programmers from the world’s large technology companies. Intel, Google, IBM, Samsung, and other companies assign programmers to help improve the code. Of the eighty thousand fixes and improvements to Linux made in the past year, more than ninety per cent were produced by paid programmers, the foundation reported in 2017; Intel employees alone were responsible for thirteen per cent of them. These same companies, and hundreds of others, covered the foundation’s roughly fifty-million-dollar annual budget.

Linux’s élite developers, who are overwhelmingly male, tend to share their leader’s aggressive self-confidence. There are very few women among the most prolific contributors, though the foundation and researchers estimate that roughly ten per cent of all Linux coders are women. “Everyone in tech knows about it, but Linus gets a pass,” Megan Squire, a computer-science professor at Elon University, told me, referring to Torvalds’s abusive behavior. “He’s built up this cult of personality, this cult of importance.”

For a research project, Squire used e-mails from Torvalds to train a computer to recognize insults. According to Squire’s tabulations, more than a thousand of the twenty-one thousand e-mails Torvalds sent in a four-year period used the word “crap.” “Slut,” “bitch,” and “bastard” were employed much less frequently during that period. Squire told me that she found few examples of gender bias. “He is an equal-opportunity abuser,” she said. Squire added, though, that for non-male programmers the hostility and public humiliation is more isolating. Over time, many women programmers leave the community. “Women throw in the towel first,” she told me. “They say, ‘Why do I need to put up with this?’ ”

In 2013, Sharp, who is nonbinary and uses “they/them” pronouns, confronted Torvalds on his home turf—the public Linux kernel mailing list. Sharp described Torvalds as “one of the worst offenders when it comes to verbally abusing people and publicly tearing their emotions apart.” At the time, Sharp, who grew up in a small town in Oregon, was in their late twenties and was an important administrator of the Linux kernel. “People assumed I was a cis woman in tech, and I received a lot of harassment because of it,” Sharp told me. Sharp tried to appeal to Torvalds on practical grounds. “I’m not asking you to change your communication styles in order to help minorities. I’m not some crazy feminist ranting about cooties on Google+” Sharp wrote. “I’m trying to improve the kernel mailing lists for all developers. We can give negative technical feedback without verbal abuse.”

Torvalds replied that the stakes were too high to care about politeness. Faulty code can have cascading effects, requiring large amounts of work from other developers to correct. Speed and accuracy are paramount. “The cursing happens for the ‘you’re so f*cking wrong that it’s not even worth trying to make logical arguments about it, because you have no possible excuse’ case . . . and sometimes people surprise me and come back with a valid excuse after all. ‘My whole family died in a tragic freak accident and my pony got cancer, and I was distracted.’ And then I might even tell them I’m sorry. No. Not really.”

Valerie Aurora, a former Linux-kernel contributor, told me that a decade of working in the Linux community convinced her that she could not rise in its hierarchy as a woman. Aurora said that the concept of Torvalds and other powerful tech figures being “equal-opportunity assholes” was false and sexist: when she and Sharp adopted Torvalds’ aggressive communication style, they experienced retaliation. “Basically, Linus has created a model of leadership—which is being an asshole,” Aurora told me. “Sage and I can tell you that being an asshole was not available to us. If we were an asshole, we got smacked for it, got punished, got held back. I tried it.”

Auro",1537530837
Raghav,,Rwbhu,"ra got her first taste of programming as a six-year-old, living with her parents in New Mexico. Her mother was the one interested in computers; she bought an IBM PCjr and taught her daughter the basicprogramming language. At the age of twelve, Aurora’s family moved to a ranch. “I would write a computer program and then go milk the goats,” Aurora recalled. She first encountered Linux at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. Around 2000, when her first fix to Linux was accepted, she threw a party. A couple of years later, she published an online manual, “HOWTO Encourage Women in Linux,” which included chapters named “Don’t criticize too much,” “Do compliment,” and “Don’t stare and point when women arrive.” Aurora told me that she was groped at a Linux conference and that a senior administrator belittled her and told she lacked the talent to be a key developer. It never occurred to her to report the groping, she said. In 2007, Aurora began to withdraw from Linux programming. She is now a consultant to tech companies working on issues of inclusion and diversity.

Many women who contribute to Linux point to another open-source project, Python, as a guide for Linux as its faces its #MeToo moment. Guido van Rossum, a white, male programmer from the Netherlands, invented the code for the Python programming language. Van Rossum, though, is a self-described feminist who often wears a “Python Is for Girls” T-shirt during his keynote addresses to Python coders. “A project attracts people who fit in the culture,” van Rossum told me, adding that if the leaders communicate abusively “it will attract people who either share that attitude, or at least don’t see a problem with it.” Van Rossum, who now lives in the Bay Area, said the Python community shows that the number of women working on open-source software projects can be increased. “I’m applying my feminist ideas or inclinations to a place where I naturally have some influence,” he said.

Mariatta Wijaya, a software engineer who was born in Indonesia and now lives and works in Vancouver, said that she attended her first Python conference in 2015, in Montreal, out of curiosity. During van Rossum’s keynote address, he admitted that there were no women among its core developers. “He said he was willing to mentor women personally, if that is what it takes to improve the diversity,” Wijaya recalled, “but I didn’t reach out to him.” The next year, she attended the same conference. “He gave another keynote and admitted that there were still no women,” she recalled, and made his same offer of mentorship. This time, Wijaya contacted van Rossum and he agreed to help. A year later, Wijaya became the first woman with core-developer privileges, which gives her the power to help decide how Python will grow and change.

Today, there are four women among roughly ninety Python core developers. This summer, van Rossum announced he would be stepping down as Python’s “benevolent dictator.” “I am not going to appoint a successor,” he wrote in a public e-mail. “So what are you all going to do? Create a democracy? Anarchy? A dictatorship? A federation?”

Torvalds, by contrast, long resisted the idea that the Linux programming team needed to become more diverse, just as he resisted calls to tone down his language. In 2015, Sharp advocated for a first-ever code of conduct for Linux developers. At a minimum, they hoped for a code that would ban doxxing—the releasing of personal information online to foment harassment—and threats of violence in the community. Instead, Torvalds accepted a programming fix provocatively titled “Code of Conflict,” which created a mechanism for filing complaints more generally. In the three years since then, no developers have been disciplined for abusive comments. Sharp, who was employed by Intel at the time, said they carefully avoided Linux kernel work thereafter.

Torvalds’s post on Sunday was a hodgepodge of apology, updates about the kernel, and coding changes that had been approved. He joked that perhaps he could find a technical fix for his bad behavior—“Maybe",1537530837
Raghav,,Rwbhu,"I can get an e-mail filter in place so at[sic] when I send e-mail with curse-words, they just won’t go out.”—before acknowledging that after he looks in the mirror, “it will be clear it’s not the only change that has to happen.” Buried within the list of approved patches was one titled “Code of Conduct: Let’s Revamp It.” It announced that the “Code of Conflict” had been replaced by a “Code of Conduct” that forbids “insulting/derogatory comments” and behavior “considered inappropriate in a professional setting.” Complaints will be heard by the foundation’s technical-advisory board, which has ten members, all men.

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It comes directly with steam as steam play so don't have to worry about it,1537887270
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And it won't work outside of steam as far as I know,1537887288
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And even though it's Open Source it's not completely open for modification or anything.,1537887372
nly,,muhfreedom,Ah,1537887388
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But as far as gaming on Linux goes it should help a lot,1537887389

nly,,muhfreedom,Ok,1537887589
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It has wine at core but all the extra stuff is what makes it better.,1537887624

nly,,muhfreedom,"Though this helps gamers not depend on windows, but now valve becomes the new MS",1537887761
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Bhai paise lagte hai development me,1537887798
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Where will that come from,1537887810
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Cause most Linux folks are on a tight budget and even if not there are so few of them to make donations for massive projects like this,1537887855
nly,,muhfreedom,I don't worry about how valve can make money.,1537887875
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And this is by far the worst way to have gaming on Linux,1537887876
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,As this will make Devs lax at making actual proper ports of their games,1537887910
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,To Linux,1537887918

Kuntal,M,hellozee,ehh? proton is open source,1537888549
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It only works with steam play afaik,1537888578
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And it can't be shared or modified for distribution so it's not very open source,1537888616
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,You can only see the source code,1537888628
nly,,muhfreedom,Sort of Cryengine style no?,1537888699
Kuntal,M,hellozee,kya?,1537888811
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Please go and read the license,1537888839
Kuntal,M,hellozee,valve cannot do this,1537888853
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Uhm why?,1537888874
Kuntal,M,hellozee,https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/blob/proton_3.7/LICENSE.proton,1537888878
nly,,muhfreedom,Yeah its not MIT but custom valve license,1537888895
nly,,muhfreedom,complicated actually,1537888937
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It can only be shared with the license applied it like an extreme version of copy left,1537888945
Kuntal,M,hellozee,look at the dependencies,1537888946
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,That's the loop hole they tapped I would say.,1537888968
nly,,muhfreedom,Anyway I wouldn't bother with this,1537889151
Kuntal,M,hellozee,It can be modified and shared we just need to keep the license,1537889151
Kuntal,M,hellozee,What loophole?,1537889163
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Like I said the loop hole is that only part of the system needs to be open source the part that depends on other open source code or is modified version of it.,1537889232
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But proton also needs steam to function,1537889245
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,That means they just locked there code without locking it,1537889258
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Whats going on guys?,1537889296
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Wait for sometime, someone will come up with something, that is open source for you",1537889310
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"If you know your way around you can obviously build it for non steam use but it also uses some features from there will be a pain to do.

But if I know the community they will do it.",1537889318
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I want Games to actually be made for Linux,1537889339
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Start and develop some,1537889353
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Most game engines can export to Linux already but no one makes them. Sad really.,1537889373
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I have made a few but only for Game Jams,1537889387
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,In my last one I got 4 place in ~150 entries world wide,1537889412
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Increased maintainence,1537889414
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,That's the prob,1537889431
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Which game engine do ya use?,1537889440
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But the problem is maintainence without benefits,1537889446
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Linux as per steam is only 0.59%,1537889465
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,User base,1537889469
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,That one was in Godot Engine it's like Unity but FOSS and better,1537889490
Kuntal,M,hellozee,ohh don't know why I never liked GDScript,1537889517
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I also work on its development fixing UI issues and all in free time. :),1537889518
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It supports C# too now,1537889533
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And you can always use GDNative to write code in C++ or any language you like,1537889564
Kuntal,M,hellozee,That is too much of work when you have SDL2,1537889613
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,GDNative is easier to setup and use than SDL2,1537889689
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"I only use SDL for more advanced projects nowadays like creating a text editor or something, for game development I don't like it that much",1537889728

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Is there a header file for Linux like windows.h that can be used to interact with the os?
And I would also need some documentation on it.",1537964901
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,what is that you are trying to do ?,1537964973
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"On what level. There are kernel headers which you can use to interact with the kernel, and there are other header files which let you, say, call shell commands",1537964976
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I would like both shell commands and some graphics stuff.,1537965022
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Elaborate on graphics stuff,1537965039
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"As low level as it gets, probably like creating a Window to render something into, then to probably directly talk to the computer for IO and so on.",1537965158

Kuntal,M,hellozee,libxcb or libX11,1537965722
Kuntal,M,hellozee,a couple examples with them https://github.com/hellozee/talks/tree/master/x11/xlibs,1537965845
Kuntal,M,hellozee,deliberately copied from the wikipedia pages,1537965915
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Oh nice. Thanks, is there no documentation or man pages for it?",1537965917
Kuntal,M,hellozee,there should be,1537965929
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I am searching thanks at least now I know what to search for (◕‿◕),1537965973

Kuntal,M,hellozee,Depends,1537966131
Kuntal,M,hellozee,GTK is cool if you are on GNOME,1537966141
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Which part?,1537966141

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Blender and Gimp are also in GTK and they look ok. 
Blender looks quite good IMHO",1537966183

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But Qt is also way bigger though,1537966225
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"It is called GIMP toolkit, it was made for GIMP",1537966235

Kuntal,M,hellozee,Blender uses OpenGL for drawing,1537966292
Kuntal,M,hellozee,and may be SDL2 for the context,1537966301
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Wasn't Blender development started before SDL2 and GTK now that I think about it I should have not believed that guy. 😑😑,1537966505
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Was it ported?,1537966515

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,That was polite just what's wrong with your reading English. This is rude,1537979186

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Uhm those are really polite and good words.,1537979301
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And informative,1537979308
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Okay,1537979318
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Hamara is pointless,1537979321
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Who are you to decide a project is pointless or not?,1537979340
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,sorry let me paraphrase,1537979353
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Tell me why do you contribute to Hamara,1537979376
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,give me one good reason i should install it,1537979383
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,and its not arch based BTW,1537979395
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,and I am having this convo for the 3rd time this year,1537979407

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Yeah mostly it's rehash of same stuff but yeah I feel them all,1537979535
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Because 1) Its a foss project 2) I find people developing it is in this community and i can meet them physically amd discuss things 3) i like doing it. 4) Whats bad in using a new distro?,1537979559
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,proud to have you in the meme police,1537979564
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,,1537979580

Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,4th is fine but stop plugging it to everybody lol,1537979612
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,"Isnt everything a 
1) FOSS project 
2) Having a big community
3) Good for you 
4) Absolutely nothing . but its up to me if i wanna use it or not",1537979621
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,exactly,1537979639
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,It's pretty clear people here don't see what you see in hamara,1537979640
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Website wound like a long boring story to the point that full page in I still can't tell what is the base distro for packages,1537979681
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"Yeah its upto. U, so please don't tell people your view.",1537979696
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Guys you nailed it Foss is actually about choice and one cannot enforce it on others,1537979704
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Why?,1537979714
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,you literally plugged your OS to me,1537979725
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Debian testing,1537979730
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Aren't you telling people your view by suggesting Hamara is better than Arch and Mint lmao,1537979731
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,No i am saying just try hamara,1537979743
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Lemme repharse it,1537979755
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Selling is ok overselling is bad :-p,1537979774
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,How hard would it have been to put relevant information like that on the front page rather than the philosophical blather,1537979793
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Enforcement is wrose,1537979794
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"If I had a say in the matter I would really like to see projects like Solus or elementary from India.

Something with newer design and features that adds to functionality.

Probably something that redefines something or does something totally new, Hamara is like a Indian version of Debian. 

Not that it's bad but not enough to be worth installing for me.",1537979840
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Okay sorry,1537979874
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Hope you know history and Indlinux project,1537979900
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,"but time and time again
FOSS doesnt care about your nationality",1537979948
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,code is independent,1537979954
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Yes it doesn't I just mean some people from India start it, but the world can help with it.

We don't need a nation specific OS.

Just something that puts India also on the map of Innovative developers.",1537980045
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,does it matter if indians or martians made it.,1537980072
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Indlinux wasn't that a Hindi Linux?,1537980073
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,No need for sorry just be aware and don't try to enforce your values and beliefs on others,1537980085
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Well if it does to you then go ahead,1537980088
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Much more check. There project page,1537980137
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Because it does not belong to anyone,1537980184
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,exactly,1537980192
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,On the contrary it belongs to everyone,1537980204
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,It's upto you how you feel,1537980224
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Nope it doesn't but I want to see the indian creativity too.... 
We are like the most budget conscious people in the world, we have strong beliefs and good ideas. 
ISRO proves that.
That turning into a distro will be fun to watch.
I probably will try, fail I might, but it's fun to code and make. 😄",1537980263
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,It's just like human emotions at play,1537980276
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,For example One may feel very strong about LGBT community others may be laughing at even the idea,1537980318
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,So I consider Foss world to be more democratic than many democracies of this world,1537980388
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"FOSS is more like a World Building game. Than a real democracy.

You can do anything and not need to care about other people's opinions.",1537980458
Raman,Tehlan,ramantehlan,+1,1537980469
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Yes go ahead and do it with your time if anyone likes it they will follow,1537980489
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,alright guys i gotta sleep now its been great having this debate,1537980498
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But others can use their opinions to make something new with you. 😄,1537980507
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,It's just getting stated,1537980522
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,unfortunately i have an exam tom,1537980539
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Ooh that's scary.,1537980553

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,@Minraws so where were we,1537980593
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Me making a new distro?,1537980606
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Yeah all ideas starts with one,1537980626
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Just do it,1537980645
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Yeah I am looking into making a Desktop Environment. At the moment.,1537980709
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,I have strong opinions about them but for now I will keep them to myself :-),1537980757
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Feel free to share I am all 👂, inam thinking a lightweight modern but minimal something.",1537980825
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It's very vague at the moment,1537980836
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Write about it in a blog and share will comment then,1537981287
Aakash,Saini,,"It’s been many years, but I still remember working with MCIT & TDIL (Min. Of Comm & IT) . 
We did lot of work on Indian Language projects along with CDAC/MCIT-IIT/R and many other institutes were involved.

Remembering worked on Translation & TransLiteration along with IIT/K, CDAC.

Further more I remember working with Mark Davis from Unicode Consortia to bring Indian language fonts to Unicode. Back days I remember we needed GIST/iLeap to work on Indian Languages.

There were 2
Standards: ISCII & ISFOC, iscii was keyboard engine standard for Indian languages and isfoc was font standard.

Sanskrit is mother of all Indian languages, where each Indian language resemble same letter as of Sanskrit with different regional glyphs and regional pronunciation.

We also worked on localization of OS. I don’t suppose the OS copy is anymore available; checkout IndusOS. I think I remember the team, it’s be more than 15yrs now!!

I ported lot of work to unix & Linux back then!!

Just saw your localization conversation above, so thought to update links from old memory!

Check out link OS in Indian language & other technologies.

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"Cool I remember all of it, especially the traniteration work which is precursor to the ML we are talking about today",1537985357
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Transiteration I meant,1537985390
Aakash,Saini,,"Great👍. I work with Dr. Anil & Dr. Sinha from IITK on translation.

I wrote complete email based on RFC in perl which supported transliteration and we deployed at CDAC noida.  Back many years 😋",1537985495
Aakash,Saini,,Both POP & SMTP,1537985517
Aakash,Saini,,👍,1537985524
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"Yeah all that is relevant nobody is denying that, the only issue I remember is the differences between CDAC Boss distribution and the Indlinux community",1537985633
Aakash,Saini,,Very true!,1537985649
Aakash,Saini,,It’s just memory😄,1537985660
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Govts fail miserably in execution and also does not want to work with community,1537985705
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Do not give credits where due,1537985730
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Work in isolation,1537985742
Aakash,Saini,,Yes. The entire work is now embedded in OS itself as Unicode.,1537985797
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Yeah those were fun times just like the Unix wars between iscii and Isfoc as standards then unicode gobbled them,1537985991
Aakash,Saini,,😄yeah!,1537986018
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Do you still work with them?,1537986197
Aakash,Saini,,No!,1537986221
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,So you must be knowing prof Rajat मूना and prof Sangal as well?,1537986315
Aakash,Saini,,I can’t say as it’s been long time. Sangal I guess I’m remembering the name but again old memory! much drained in new technology😋,1537987032

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Yes correct,1537987324
Aakash,Saini,,That great! You remember them😋,1537987343

vi/Unix and emacs! Then with time I got to switch to better editors which supported better control on programming, switches to eclipse, then to IDE which came along with FORTE compilers, supporting TeamWare, then to Netbeans! which literally supported many module, more than eclipse and repository attachments.

My point in saying above is you should prefer advance IDEs for faster and smooth programming, else you will be not only slow down, but will not be corporate competitive & match requirements, further getting in loop of command line action.
vi/*nix is sufficient.",1538161586

Aakash,Saini,,"1. Intellisense is like auto-completion dictionary for codes! aka. Auto Code-completion suggestion.. 

2. There is a big difference between *debugger* & *profiler*.

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"1. Yes intellisense is autocomplete as I said but overall it's better. So no debates there.

2. When did I say profiler and debugger are the same? I kinda don't know why you got that idea.

3. And I use both debugger and profiler quite a bit, mostly to learn, I probably don't know how industry professionals use it.
I have tried to use FOSS debuggers for C++ but they aren't ever as polished as Visual Studio's.

Also intellisense is not Microsoft specific it is not hard to implement with all the language servers being so easy to use. Still intellisense is just a lot more polished in the heavier IDEs like Visual Studio and CLion.",1538195829

[1] Since hacktoberfest has just started and there are many people willing to start contributing (1. Becuase they want to. 2. Outreachy applications. 3. Upcoming GSoC), can we have that Dev Sprint somewhere in the middle of this month?
Say 13th or 14th October?
This way, people who are willing to contribute can get a kick start and others get a lovely environment and atmosphere to work in.

P.S. Not to forget, the stats for the poll were very high, that is, they wanted to have it and were extremely interested. 
We also had this discussion in the PyDelhi meetup and got a good amount of response for the same.",1538405324

Chaitanya,Arora,Chaitanyaarora,,1538461284
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,The compiler of rust is really smart and the best feature of rust. Overall.,1538461432
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And there is no println function in rust there is rather a Macro for the purpose.,1538461639
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,its println!,1538470715
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Yep that's the macro for printing stuff.

Rust has a sort of convention of naming macros with a postfix of !",1538471320
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Really makes it easier to see what is a macro and what's not.,1538471341
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,You can use various traits to use the Macro println!,1538471365
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,The awesome thing is that anything with a debug trait implementation can be printed using the macro,1538471484
Kuntal,M,hellozee,so does c++ if you write the wrong constructor,1538471486
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Difference is that Rust does it for everything. Although these helpers can be stopped if you so desire.,1538471840
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Any class with an overloaded << friend function will do the job for c++,1538471904
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,??,1538472023
Kuntal,M,hellozee,it should sound okayish now,1538472085

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,True but that's just an example. 😜,1538472188
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I use Rust for its non OOP structure and high performance combined with it's Borrowing principle reducing chances for data races significantly.,1538472264
Kuntal,M,hellozee,I Go,1538472294
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But it's not everyone's cup of tea that non OOP really bugs some people out.,1538472297
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I use Go when I am not concerned about performance cause it has an agressive GC.,1538472326

Shivam,,g33kyshivam,This,1539440176
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,This too,1539440196
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Thats why we check your disk,1539440212
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,To check for screw ups,1539440224
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,I had a problem like this once. Quite a lot of people suggested → https://www.runtime.org/data-recovery-live-cd.htm,1539440259
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Never tried it,1539440279
cocoa,,cocoa1231,We will mount that partition in read only mode and look at it,1539440326
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But first let's recover the files eh?,1539440338
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Sure just creating a bootable live ubuntu,1539440376
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Ok im in the live boot,1539440676
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,,1539440692
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,@cocoa1231 @arcsaber,1539440709
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"So I'm not a Debian guy, so I'll do this how I used to do it, when I used ubuntu as my daily driver. God that was long ago",1539440769
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Open up an app called software sources,1539440778
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I this it's still called that,1539440787
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"And tick all the repositories that are there. Universe, multiverse etc.",1539440808
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"And when you try to close it, it should ask to update software cache or something like that, do it, wait for it, and the try to install testdisk",1539440835
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Okay,1539440849
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Done,1539440860
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,What next,1539440878
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Do you also have an external drive to put the recovered files into?,1539440890
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Because you can't write to your hard disk while you're recovering,1539440906
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,My whole HDD got deleted t,1539440938
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"If all went well, sudo apt install testdisk should work",1539440938
cocoa,,cocoa1231,External?,1539440946
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Yes installed testdisk,1539440956
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,I have,1539440973
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,I have some backup already stored in thay,1539440985
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Your whole internal hard drive couldn't have gotten deleted. You were running your OS just now. Its still got stuff on it,1539440993
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Sure. As long as you gave enough space,1539441005
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Launch testdisk by just typing in testdisk,1539441021
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Oh wait, maybe it is sudo testdisk",1539441034
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,,1539441036
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Now,1539441059
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Press Ctrl+c and exit out of it,1539441068
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Type in sudo testdisk,1539441076
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Forgot to add the sudo last time,1539441083

Shivam,,g33kyshivam,These are my missing files,1539442183
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Relief aint it,1539442201
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Sweet, press colon ( : ) to select the files, and press c to recover them
BUT plug in your external drive right now if you haven't already",1539442221
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,i told you i didn't run thr rm -rf command,1539442230
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I feel so professional,1539442230
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Extra BTCs,1539442247
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Is this not possible to recovery in the same disk,1539442283
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"No, because that'll require writing",1539442293
cocoa,,cocoa1231,To the target,1539442299
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,I mean my entire home directory files got hidden,1539442304
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Which will override the data you're trying to recover,1539442306
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,"Ok , can you check is there amy other alternative to this",1539442337
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,I mean the files were not deleted,1539442355
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Why? I thought you had an external drive?,1539442359
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yes they were. If they're in red, then they were",1539442369
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Otherwise you would have been able to see them by just doing ls -l,1539442378
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Yaa i dont have an empty hard disk,1539442379
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"dd if=Downloads/linuxmint-18.2-cinnamon-64bit.iso of=/dev/DISK_IMG progress=status bs=4M

cocoa,,cocoa1231,You better empty your hard disk,1539442389
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,well i know the pendrive name is DISK_IMG,1539442391
cocoa,,cocoa1231,:P,1539442392
cocoa,,cocoa1231,No where to put that,1539442400
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Not by name. try doing ls /dev | grep DISK_IMG,1539442413
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Umm wow,1539442414
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You won't find anything named DISK_IMG. You have to specify something like /dev/sdXY,1539442441
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,So i have to take my imp files now,1539442479
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,nah nothing is there,1539442491

Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,i have a pendrive that i got in devsprint,1539442557
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Nope. You have to recover the data to an external device,1539442558
.,,rajudev,I never did,1539442570
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Exactly. It's not identified as DISK_IMG,1539442575
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Lels you did that,1539442581
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,On my PC,1539442586
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"so , how to find it ?",1539442593
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"it's identified as /dev/sdXY where X, Y are whole numbers",1539442594
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Wait, Y is",1539442600
cocoa,,cocoa1231,X is a letter,1539442602

Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Ohh boy😳,1539444135

Kuntal,M,hellozee,you can,1539455466
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Everytime I did failed. I would have to mount /dev/sda1 (ESP) into /boot/efi which is on the live system,1539455486

Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,massive drop today at 6,1540113659

drakula,,p5g41tmlx,But B2Rs are generally VM boxes,1540113750

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Its dual core hyperthreaded. I'm not putting that much load on it at once,1540137275
.,,rajudev,"If you just want to spook, go ahead. but you are providing the wrong info.",1540137286
cocoa,,cocoa1231,It chugs and sometimes grinds to a halt,1540137286
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,ouch,1540137292
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Very relatable,1540137306
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, I'll take my packages pre compiled, thank you",1540137319
.,,rajudev,and FYI debian supports most hardware/processor architectures than anyone else out there.,1540137333
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,we had a community call @9??,1540137341
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,*HAD*,1540137348
Kuntal,M,hellozee,just set a single core for portage and use the other for firefox,1540137350
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1540137352
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,I mean I'm not averse to compiling things for myself but everything is a bit of a stretch,1540137352
cocoa,,cocoa1231,compilation sloooows down so much...,1540137374
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"gentoo has binary packges, there too",1540137381
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, exactly",1540137384
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But then what's the point of it?,1540137392
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,I build my own kernel and git among other stuff but kill me if I need to compile the DE and shit too,1540137394
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,+1 debian has best portability,1540137397
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,as well,1540137405
Kuntal,M,hellozee,You just install binary packages of those which take too much time like firefox,1540137431
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,or Chromium,1540137456
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"compiling DE is not that much, but the programs which come with it are",1540137458
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But I can do that with arch too. I just use the PKGBUILDS for the packages I want to buold,1540137459
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,which doesn't take time,1540137460
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,takes an eternity,1540137465
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Like telegram,1540137466
.,,rajudev,"also I get the fact that Mint works for you and Debian does not, fine. Whatever floats the boat. But your reasons for hate are not correct.",1540137466
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,and a server farm,1540137467
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Then you don't have portage,1540137478
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,agreed,1540137483
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I'm fine with that :P,1540137516
